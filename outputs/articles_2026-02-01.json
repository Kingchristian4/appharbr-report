      "content": "Powered by: July 28, 2020 Fake Ads Aren't Facebook's Only Woe BAD ADS Act Bullies Section 230 What Pubs and Brands Need to Know About CCPA Podcasts Hit Their Stride Facebook Problems: Real Brands, Fake Ads Facebook is ankle-deep in troubles as of late. For one, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll all be checking into the live stream of the big tech antitrust hearings taking place tomorrow to hear Zuck tell Congress how much America needs his company to be really fit in order to stave off undue Chines social media influences. Senior Editor, Lynne d Johnson, already has her dragon popcorn at the ready. But these are not the Facebook issues we\u2019re referring to. We\u2019re not even talking about the social media giant\u2019s cage match vs Australia. Which already has the company scrambling to make deals with publishers ahead of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission finalizing regs that would force them to lay out the cash. Nor are we talking about major brands like Coca-Cola and the NorthFace ditching Facebook in the fight against hate speech on the networks platform. No dear Monster, we\u2019re talking about something altogether different. Problem #4 this month for the big F would be scam ads portraying real products and services leading to damaged brand reputations and consumer mistrust. Over 70 ads from consumer and apparel brands, ranging from Patagonia to JP, have been affected by fraudulent ads appearing on Facebook and Instagram, according to a new report from the Transnational Alliance to Combat Trade. These brands aren't taking this sitting down either. They\u2019re taking action and applying pressure to Facebook to take greater control over which ads make it through its pipes. Of note, some of the brands hardest hit by scam ads are also pausing spend on Facebook for #StopHateForProfit. The fact that it\u2019s so easy to deploy fake ads on Facebook would make any brand take pause. There's a big question here: If publishers can find solutions to fight scummy ads, why can't Facebook? If you pay careful attention to how we outlined all of Facebook\u2019s current conundrums in this one post, you might have caught on that the focus isn\u2019t only Facebook's fake ads' mess. Facebook is one cocky son of a B, as evidenced by how Zuck plans to deal with Congress. Even his initial response to the ACCC sounded as if the company never intended to pay any publisher for news content, citing that it has minimal revenue impact. Further, a meeting with Civil Rights leaders about how Facebook approaches content didn\u2019t end very well for the leaders. Basically Facebook hasn't agreed to take a stance against hate speech (or even misinformation for that matter). This issue with scam ads and how their treating advertisers reeks of a similar disposition. Will FB be forced to change its ways? We\u2019ve already seen some headway with talks about banning political advertising on the site. And Facebook already has tools for authorizing political ads but it doesn\u2019t seem like it's enough. Likewise, there are tools for companies to report fraudulent content, but according to Cat Zakrzewski, a technology policy reporter for The Washington Post, brands say that isn\u2019t enough. In recent days, the company did take down false COVID info shared by Trump. But when pressure is coming at you from all angles, eventually something has to give. BAD Ads Act Bullies 230 Woo, hoo, it\u2019s finally here\u2014legislation that could remove immunity protections under Section 230 related to behavioral advertising! Oh, wait, big sorry, that probably sounded like we had good news to share. It was more sarcasm, because, well, we expected it. The bill, \u201cBehavioral Advertising Decisions Are Downgrading Services (Bad Ads) Act,\u201d introduced by Republican Senator Josh Hawley, would clamp down on invasive data gathering by the duopoly used for behavioral targeting (and any other big tech company with either 30 million users in the U.S. or 300 million worldwide and $1.5 billion in global revenue). Just in case you forgot, Section 230 protects online businesses from legal action over user-generated content. If this bill passes, it could remove 230\u2019s immunity for a 30-day period following each violation. Without 230 to protect them, companies like Facebook and Google would even be liable for those very same scammy ads we talked about earlier. So even if Facebook and Google don\u2019t put the necessary tools in place to crack down on fraudulent advertising, a bill like BAD ADS could do more than just twist their mammoth-sized tech arms. Not surprisingly, Hawley\u2019s isn\u2019t the only bill with its finger on the trigger of a loaded gun pointed at 230, ready to strip digital media properties of these very necessary protections. Even for the walled gardens, 230 still seems like an alright measure\u2014it\u2019s just that those companies should be making stronger efforts to protect users from loathsome content and nefarious ads. As we\u2019ve opined once before: TL; DR Leave 230 alone. You got other fish to fry. CCPA: What Publishers and Advertisers Need to Know The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) has been top of mind for the past two years since it was enacted in June of 2018. It went into effect on January 1, 2020, and legal enforcement of the Act began on July 1, 2020. The CCPA introduces new data privacy rights for California residents \u2013 forcing companies that conduct business in the state of California to implement structural changes to their privacy programs. There is a lot going on around the world these days, including news surrounding the CCPA. For example, Facebook recently launched a new Limited Data Use (LDU) Feature to support companies with CCPA compliance and last month, IAB Tech Lab released its technical data deletion spec to help publishers signal opt-out requests downstream to third-party vendors. Additionally, the industry is already looking ahead to CCPA 2.0 (or CPRA) which is on the ballot for November 2020. One CCPA requirement is very clear: if a business has a direct relationship with consumers and sells their personal information to third-party companies, it should provide a notice at the time of collection and include a \u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Information\u201d link or button on its website or in its CMP that allows California users to opt-out of that sale. Another requirement is to allow consumers to send in requests to access and delete personal information, as well as the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information. This would apply to content subscribers, mobile or OTT app users, or just a regular website visitor. Publishers and advertisers now need a scalable and efficient way to process and respond to consumer rights requests and must maintain detailed, ongoing records for CCPA compliance. For publishers unsure of next steps, the IAB created the IAB CCPA Compliance Framework last year to help meet the CCPA \u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Information\u201d requirement. This framework creates a unified approach and contractual relationship between digital properties and the downstream framework participants to enforce limitations on the use of data and mechanisms for accountability. Last month, the IAB Tech Lab released its technical data deletion spec which allows publishers to propagate data deletion requests to their ad tech partners. Implementing the framework and signing the limited-service provider agreement are the simplest ways for publishers to pass these requests to downstream partners under a unified framework that governs how those signals should be treated. If you have not adjusted your privacy program to comply with CCPA requirements, be sure to get started to avoid penalties and fines. WITH THE SUPPORT OF OneTrust Podcast Payday When journalists write about the streamers doing well amid the pandemic, we expect them to be talking about Netflix, Hulu and of course, Roku. But why isn't anybody talking about audio? That's where the recent IAB US Podcast Advertising Revenue Study comes in. Although commuter podcast listens went down in recent months, as people were working from home they turned their listening ears to a lot more lifestyle and entertainment content. Health and wellness and comedy topped content category lists, as well as content about COVID. For advertisers, podcasts are becoming a highly-engaging medium. According to eMarketer, 30% of listeners purchase something after hearing a sponsored ad on a podcast. Overall, IAB expects the market to grow by 14.7% YoY, projecting it'll reach $1B by the end of March '21. Spotify, iHeart and Sirius have all made heavy bets in the space recently. Spotify launched video podcasts on the heels of a colossal deal with podcaster extraordinaire Joe Rogan. iHeart Media is steadily building out original content offerings for its comedy podcast partnership with Will Ferrell. And SiriusXM acquired Stitcher podcasting company for $325 million in recent weeks. If the IAB report's numbers hold up, looks like these guys just might turn their investments into paydirt. We've got our money on Spotify becoming the Netflix of audio. But there's a major lesson in here for pubs too. It's time to get your podcast monetization strategy in play. For those of you who still don't, we're looking askance at you right now. \ud83d\udc40 @AdContrarian Should be good theater this week as 4 of the world's most powerful men pretend they give a shit about what congress thinks. In. The. Weeds. with Paul Bannister Paul Bannister, Chief Strategy Officer, CafeMedia walks the hosts through WTF the W3C is and why publishers need to start caring, quickly. They get deep into how publishers need to get involved, the risks when ad tech companies claim to speak for publishers, and whether anything will even get done.

      "summary": "The results of GeoEdge\u2019s Q1 Ad Quality Report are worrying, which is why Yuval Shiboli, Director of Product Marketing is sounding the alarm.",
      "content": "In February, the FTC reported that U.S. consumers lost $8.8 billion to scams, many of which occurred online. The volume of scams is up 30% over 2021 and is 70% higher than it was in 2020. The surge in malvertising has been a source of concern for Yuval Shiboli, Director of Product Marketing at GeoEdge. From 2022 to 2023, his company monitored and analyzed billions of live advertising impressions across premium websites, apps, and SSPs to assess the overall ad quality in today\u2019s digital ecosystem. The results, published in GeoEdge\u2019s Q1 Ad Quality Report are worrying, which is why Yuval is sounding the alarm. The results show that scammers changed tactics around 2020, shifting from using auto-redirects to lure users to malicious domains, to relying on clickbait ads to take them to these destinations. Yuval is concerned that if the industry doesn\u2019t make a serious dent in malicious ads and malvertising, consumers will cease to click on ads and even cut back on their online news consumption \u2014 developments that will have far-reaching ramifications for the industry and society as a whole. To understand the extent of the problem, we asked Yuval about GeoEdge\u2019s most recent Ad Quality Report. How Malvertising Shapes Behavior and Threatens An Industry AdMonsters: Your report shows a significant uptick in malicious and clickbait advertising since the first of the year. Can you explain why that is? Yuval Shiboli: I think we can thank the recession and its impact on market expectations for that. With advertisers cutting back their ad spend, floor prices are dropping, publishers are accepting lower bids, which is causing the average CPM to decrease. This phenomenon leads to a greater volume of low-quality ads being placed in publications, as there is a strong correlation between the price and quality level of advertising. Additionally, now that some SSPs are loosening their tight grip on advertisers, it\u2019s easier to enter the market with new scams and tactics. AdMonsters: Of all the impressions that are filled with ads, what percentage of those ads are scams or malicious? Yuval: It depends on the country. In the US, it\u2019s one out of every 170 ads. In the UK it\u2019s one out of every 140. AdMonsters: Wow, I thought it was one out of a thousand or so. Yuval: You\u2019re not alone. Most people in the industry believe the same, but the problem is much more severe. 87% of Clickbait Ads From Just Two SSPs AdMonsters: Your report says that 87% of the clickbait ads you\u2019ve measured stem from just two SSPs. Are publishers aware of where these ads come from? Yuval: If they work with an ad security solution they\u2019ll be able to see exactly how each SSP performs, and which ones deliver the most clickbait ads and malvertising. Those ads won\u2019t be displayed, of course. But they should take that data to the SSP and ask them to address it. GeoEdge relays ad quality data to SSPs, but the amplification of our collective voice is bound to compel SSPs to take action. AdMonsters: Are the SSPs responding to your reports? Yuval: Some are, some aren\u2019t. Again we see a strong correlation between performance and response. The platforms that don\u2019t pay attention to the reports deliver the most low-quality ads. AdMonsters: As the largest SSP in the market, how does Google fit in the uptick of scams? Yuval: Everybody on both the sell side and buy side works with Google, and everyone assumes that its platforms are clean and safe. We\u2019ve found the opposite is true, and that of all the SSP providers, Google is the least motivated to block bad ads. Now that so many SSPs have left the market, no one can stop working with them, and they know it. ...of all the SSP providers, Google is the least motivated to block bad ads. I just read Google\u2019s 2022 Ad Quality Report, in which they reported for the entire year they blocked 5.2 billion ads, which sounds like a lot. But read the fine print, and we learn that most of those ads are blocked for reasons such as copyright infringement or third parties using trademarks they\u2019re not entitled to use. On one page of the report, however, we see that Google blocked just 4.5 million ads for malicious or unwanted software. We know that hundreds of millions of such ads are served. If Google did more to stop such ads, we could spare the consumer a lot of pain. Misleading Product Offers Most Notorious Clickbait AdMonsters: What are some of the clickbait ads you see most frequently? Yuval: There\u2019s a section in the Ad Quality Report where we detail the top five scams that we block. The most frequent are misleading product offers, such as fantastical financial offers. This time last year the scams were all about crypto, but they are less so now. Now we\u2019re seeing ads promising medical transformations, such as hair regrowth, that type of thing. Celebrity endorsements are another common tactic. These ads will say things like, \u201cSee what Elon Musk invests in,\u201d in order to lure people into a scam investment. AdMonsters: Why are these obviously fake ads getting through the SSPs? Yuval: The successful scammers use fingerprinting and cloaking to ply their craft. Ad cloaking is a sophisticated camouflage technique that scammers use in the programmatic ad environment to hide malicious creatives and landing pages. With cloaking, scammers only expose scam ads after their campaigns have been scanned by the SSP and deemed safe. The fraudsters are very selective in who they show their malicious ads, looking for users who are scam-worthy, meaning there is no security detection software in the environment. AdMonsters: The report talks about luring people to malicious destinations. Explain this scam. Yuval: These are ads that typically involve fake celebrity endorsements that lead users to a page that\u2019s designed to look like a legitimate site, such as People magazine. For instance, scammers these days are using fake Kevin Costner endorsements for a range of products, such as CBD gummies. The user clicks, is taken to a malicious page, and enters his or her credit card information for a product that never arrives. AdMonsters: According to your research, forced browser notifications are one of the most frequent techniques to scam users. How do they work? Yuval: These types of scams exploit push notification functionality, which itself isn\u2019t inherently bad. Forced browser notification scams occur when a user clicks on the scammer\u2019s ad and is taken to a landing page but in order to access the content, the user must click \u201callow.\u201d Most people don\u2019t understand what it means to allow a site to push notifications to their browsers, so they click. Once they do, it opens a gateway for the scammer to push all sorts of notifications to the user, such as a popup saying that a virus has been detected on their computers. How Publishers Can Keep Scams Off of Their Sites AdMonsters: How can publishers keep such scams off of their sites? Yuval: First, the SSPs need to test campaigns on a continuous basis so that they are prevented from purchasing inventory to begin with. And publishers need to look at the entire ad experience, meaning the ad and the landing page to which users are led. AdMonsters: Who is responsible for combating these types of scams within the publisher\u2019s organization? Yuval: It typically falls to the AdOps group, which is responsible for monetizing the site and generating revenue. Typically we don\u2019t see a position like a \u201cfraud czar\u201d or something like that. The AdOps people we\u2019ve spoken to are highly frustrated because they don\u2019t have the tools to fight malvertising effectively or to even tie back bad ads to the SSPs that sold them. They spend a lot of time optimizing revenue, A/B testing, and trying new SSPs, but then they hear about a malicious ad from the editorial team and they\u2019re at a loss as to how it arrived on their sites or how to prevent them. AdMonsters: Are there tools to prevent malicious ads, and to verify that the landing pages aren\u2019t full of malvertising? Yuval: Yes, of course, and the strongest ones are those that can detect scams after a user clicks on the ad, a functionality that is critical now that the majority of scams occur post-click. But publishers must be willing to pay for them. They need to hear from their users that malvertising and malicious ads are spurring distrust in online news.

      "content": "Friday, November 7th, 2025 \u2013 12:03 am SHARE: It\u2019s A Metastrophe! Meta reported solid Q3 earnings, but here\u2019s an awkward revelation: Apparently, Meta expects that around 10% of its annual revenue will likely come from fraudulent ads. According to documents shown to Reuters, Meta has exposed its users to financial fraud over the past three years in the form of ads for investment schemes, illegal online casinos and the sale of banned medical products. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone says in a statement that the documents \u201cpresent a selective view that distorts Meta\u2019s approach to fraud and scams\u201d and that the initial 10% estimate is \u201crough and overly-inclusive.\u201d He did not provide specific figures. Another shocking reveal is that Meta\u2019s ad system only flags ads as part of a scam if its automated detection reaches an extremely high confidence level \u2013 over 95% \u2013 meaning that most scam ads slip through. But, as Reuters reports, Meta was aware that certain advertiser accounts were up to no good and responded by charging those advertisers higher rates \u2013 thus profiting more from scam ads than ads from good-faith advertisers. Advertisers on Meta, and Google for that matter, have long struggled with ad fraud on these platforms as well as bugs and glitches that, in general, prove quite lucrative to the walled gardens. And to add insult to injury, when forced to issue refunds, platforms typically do so in ad credits. Subscription Conniption The rapid growth of AI vendor tech has put software as a service companies in a strange position. For one, incumbent software providers are LLM power users. Also, SaaS customers often begrudge their purportedly \u201csticky\u201d vendor partners. Some brands will opt for an OpenAI subscription and then just feed it prompts like \u201ccreate a customer review software tool that plugs into Shopify.\u201d The latest indignity, The Information reports, is that LLMs have figured out how to take advantage of SaaS pricing policies to negotiate down the price of a given vendor\u2019s tech. The AI will scan contracts, renewals and third-party data sources to identify opportunities to reduce subscription vendor costs. The agent will then draft an email that purportedly comes from the business\u2019s own procurement department. From there, it will negotiate prices down. It\u2019s easy to see how this dynamic could naturally extend to other types of subscriptions. For example, news and entertainment subscriptions, as well as shopping membership programs, will often offer a steep discount when subscribers are just about to hit that final \u201cconfirm\u201d to unsubscribe button. An AI tool could help apply that approach at scale. The Ult-AI-mate Showdown People like to say AI is a great equalizer or democratizer of tech. Advertisers can generate higher-quality content at a faster rate for less money \u2013 so, where\u2019s the downside? The loser in this equation is generally thought to be the agencies, although the aforementioned SaaS providers are taking a hit, too. And as the popularity of generative AI continues to rise, whispered rumors of the demise of agencies only get louder. The thing is, agencies themselves don\u2019t think they\u2019re facing an existential crisis. WPP is leaning into AI with an increased AI investment of 300 million pounds ($390.7 million) this year, compared to 250 million last year, The Wall Street Journal reports. There have been major reductions in the cost to produce an ad, but clients are asking agencies to create more content, so there isn\u2019t necessarily a revenue dip, according to WPP CTO Stephan Pretorius. Although, he also said WPP has plans for \u201cattacking the mid-market and smaller brands\u201d with its self-serve Open Pro product. Looks like agencies are getting out of the services business to some degree. But Wait! There\u2019s More!

      "content": "The Rise of Deceptive Mobile Games Ads By Gavin Grady 9 October 2024 In recent years, mobile games have exploded in popularity, capturing the attention of millions worldwide. However, as competition for downloads intensifies, some mobile game developers have resorted to questionable marketing practices\u2014particularly, the use of fake gameplay ads. These misleading ads often show gameplay mechanics that do not exist in the actual game, leaving users frustrated and feeling deceived after downloading the app. The Birth of Fake Ads When mobile games first began gaining traction, their ads generally showcased the real gaming experience, or an embellished version of gameplay. However, as the mobile gaming market became more and more competitive, developers started turning to more eye-catching, often fabricated ads to stand out. The explosion of hyper-casual games, and their highly competitive growth strategies has brought to light a whole new strategy to bring users to their titles. A strategy that saw potential new game mechanics tested as an ad before ever becoming a game. A route that gave publishers knowledge that users were interested in such a mechanic or not, and whether the CPI of said advert was lower than their needed revenue in order to gain a profitable ROAS. Other publishers that weren\u2019t in the hyper-casual game were suddenly taking notice of this strategy, and began to play with it themselves. Playrix, the company behind popular games like Homescapes and Gardenscapes, frequently displayed ads that showed unique and highly engaging puzzle-solving mechanics, showcasing their storytelling gameplay which separated them from the\u2026KING(pun intended) match-3 game, Candy Crush. Until they realised that these new publishers were growing at insane rates, bringing users to their titles for pennies. So, as any large company with the sight of increasing profits would, they ran at it - because if you can\u2019t beat them, join them. The new ads that were being published would depict a scenario in which players had to make decisions such as \"pulling pins\" to save a character from danger. These puzzle-like mechanics were highly attractive to users. However, once users downloaded the games, they found that this type of gameplay was either extremely rare or absent altogether. The actual games were much more focused on match-3 puzzles, not the gripping decision-making moments shown in the ads. This prompted the ASA to issue a ban on these misleading ads in 2020, labeling them a breach of advertising rules due to their misleading nature. Fake App Store Listings As the fake ads continue to develop, publishers have gone another step further, and edited their whole store listing to simulate those ads, some go so far to hide the fact there is a game in there at all. Here are just a few icons from titles that are high in the top grossing charts, showcasing their ads as icons instead of an icon that represents gameplay in any way, giving the user more reason to think the game is the ad they\u2019ve just seen. What About the Ethical Implications? Whether it's a pull the pin, running through gates, or choices feature you\u2019re faced with, the reason they continue to grow and grow is simple. Profit. These ads bring in lots of users at a cheap price, and with the quantity of users, they will get enough of them that go onto play the game and eventually spend to make a profit. With all of the studios closing, and redundancies happening within our industry, it seems to me that right now, honesty is certainly not the best policy anymore. The app stores have gotten lazy, allowing store listings to feature gameplay that aren\u2019t part of the core loop, something that used to be VERY difficult to get through, especially on the App Store. The Impact on User Trust The popularity of fake gameplay in mobile ads has had a significant impact on user trust. Players are left feeling misled and cheated after downloading a game that does not deliver the experience promised in the advertisements. This erosion of trust can have long-term consequences for the mobile gaming industry, as users may become increasingly skeptical of all game ads, including those that are truthful. In a market that thrives on engagement and retention, losing the trust of users is a significant issue. When players feel misled, they are less likely to continue playing the game, make in-game purchases, or recommend it to others. In turn, developers may lose out on potential revenue streams. More importantly, the continuous spread of fake ads can tarnish the reputation of the mobile gaming industry as a whole, making it harder for developers who follow ethical practices to compete. How to Fight Back Against Fake Ads As mobile game users, it\u2019s crucial to be aware of these deceptive practices and take steps to avoid falling for misleading ads. Here are several ways that both users and platforms can fight against the spread of fake gameplay ads: 1. Report Misleading Ads: Most advertising platforms allow users to report ads that they find misleading. Taking a moment to report fake gameplay ads can help reduce the frequency with which they appear and push platforms to take more action against dishonest developers. 2. Leave Honest Reviews: One of the most effective ways to warn potential players about misleading games is to leave an honest review on the app store. Be specific in detailing how the game differs from its advertisement, as this helps others make informed decisions before downloading. 3. Push for Stricter Regulations: While the ASA\u2019s ruling against Playrix was a step in the right direction, more needs to be done. Players and consumer protection organizations should continue to push for stricter regulations globally, ensuring that game developers are held accountable for misleading advertisements. We need both the governments, app stores and ad networks to begin fighting back against fake ads. Speak about this at the next networking event you attend, and speak with your account managers about it mattering to you. 4. Use Ad Transparency Tools: Some ad platforms are beginning to introduce tools that provide transparency into how ads are displayed. Explore these tools - they may come at an extra cost, but remember, a bad ad experience in your game will leave a sour taste in that user's mouth. Final Thoughts The use of fake gameplay in mobile ads has created a trust deficit between developers and users, and while regulatory actions are an important step, more needs to be done. Players must be vigilant and vocal about deceptive ads, while developers and platforms must adopt ethical advertising practices to restore trust and ensure the long-term health of the industry. Only through collective effort can we curb this harmful trend and create a fairer, more transparent mobile gaming landscape. Turning the market into an honest, and ethical space will take time, but small steps can be taken today to start making a difference in the future.

      "content": "The Rise of Deceptive Mobile Games Ads By Gavin Grady 9 October 2024 In recent years, mobile games have exploded in popularity, capturing the attention of millions worldwide. However, as competition for downloads intensifies, some mobile game developers have resorted to questionable marketing practices\u2014particularly, the use of fake gameplay ads. These misleading ads often show gameplay mechanics that do not exist in the actual game, leaving users frustrated and feeling deceived after downloading the app. The Birth of Fake Ads When mobile games first began gaining traction, their ads generally showcased the real gaming experience, or an embellished version of gameplay. However, as the mobile gaming market became more and more competitive, developers started turning to more eye-catching, often fabricated ads to stand out. The explosion of hyper-casual games, and their highly competitive growth strategies has brought to light a whole new strategy to bring users to their titles. A strategy that saw potential new game mechanics tested as an ad before ever becoming a game. A route that gave publishers knowledge that users were interested in such a mechanic or not, and whether the CPI of said advert was lower than their needed revenue in order to gain a profitable ROAS. Other publishers that weren\u2019t in the hyper-casual game were suddenly taking notice of this strategy, and began to play with it themselves. Playrix, the company behind popular games like Homescapes and Gardenscapes, frequently displayed ads that showed unique and highly engaging puzzle-solving mechanics, showcasing their storytelling gameplay which separated them from the\u2026KING(pun intended) match-3 game, Candy Crush. Until they realised that these new publishers were growing at insane rates, bringing users to their titles for pennies. So, as any large company with the sight of increasing profits would, they ran at it - because if you can\u2019t beat them, join them. The new ads that were being published would depict a scenario in which players had to make decisions such as \"pulling pins\" to save a character from danger. These puzzle-like mechanics were highly attractive to users. However, once users downloaded the games, they found that this type of gameplay was either extremely rare or absent altogether. The actual games were much more focused on match-3 puzzles, not the gripping decision-making moments shown in the ads. This prompted the ASA to issue a ban on these misleading ads in 2020, labeling them a breach of advertising rules due to their misleading nature. Fake App Store Listings As the fake ads continue to develop, publishers have gone another step further, and edited their whole store listing to simulate those ads, some go so far to hide the fact there is a game in there at all. Here are just a few icons from titles that are high in the top grossing charts, showcasing their ads as icons instead of an icon that represents gameplay in any way, giving the user more reason to think the game is the ad they\u2019ve just seen. What About the Ethical Implications? Whether it's a pull the pin, running through gates, or choices feature you\u2019re faced with, the reason they continue to grow and grow is simple. Profit. These ads bring in lots of users at a cheap price, and with the quantity of users, they will get enough of them that go onto play the game and eventually spend to make a profit. With all of the studios closing, and redundancies happening within our industry, it seems to me that right now, honesty is certainly not the best policy anymore. The app stores have gotten lazy, allowing store listings to feature gameplay that aren\u2019t part of the core loop, something that used to be VERY difficult to get through, especially on the App Store. The Impact on User Trust The popularity of fake gameplay in mobile ads has had a significant impact on user trust.

      "content": "SHAPING WHAT\u2019S NEXT IN MEDIA Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 SECURE YOUR SEAT Generative AI Updated: DoubleVerify report, Ad fraud schemes using generative AI will increase in scale, sophistication By Marty Swant \u2022 June 18, 2024 \u2022 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Ivy Liu Correction: A previous version of this story contained a quote that made unsubstantiated claims without giving DoubleVerify the opportunity to refute or comment on those claims. Ad fraud often follows the flow of advertising dollars, but researchers now suggest scammers are also now following another industry trend: adoption of generative AI. Generative AI is helping scale sophisticated ad fraud efforts across growing online ad platforms including connected TV and streaming audio, according to a report from DoubleVerify. The measurement giant reported that generative AI contributed to 23% growth in new fraud schemes in 2023, leading to a 58% increase in ad fraud on streaming platforms. The report, released Monday, analyzed 1 trillion impressions for 2,000 brands in 100 markets around the world and includes data about ads shown on desktop, mobile web, mobile app and connected TV platforms. Researchers also found evidence of a 269% increase in existing bot fraud schemes while incident types included bot fraud, site fraud, app fraud, hijacked devices, non-human data center traffic and injected ad events. Generative AI has made it easier to falsify data patterns and make fraudulent traffic look more human. The proliferation of AI-generated content also helps fraudsters create new shell company websites, publish new apps and write fake reviews. That\u2019s been especially key for cases in the mobile app space. Generative AI has also helped CTV ad scams evolve three times faster in 2023 than in 2022, according to Jack Smith, DoubleVerify\u2019s chief innovation officer. The trend is expected to continue through 2024 as generative AI tools become more capable, more ubiquitous and easier to use. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a problem for advertisers, it\u2019s a problem for publishers as well,\u201d Smith told Digiday. \u201cBecause it\u2019s funneling money away from legitimate traffic. So if you\u2019re spoofing a well known app, then you\u2019re basically siphoning money out of the ecosystem. It has a negative effect for both publishers and advertisers.\u201d Two examples of scams using generative AI are FM Scam and CycloneBot, according to DoubleVerify, which unmasked both scams earlier this year. CycloneBot, a CTV-focused scam, is harder to detect because it uses AI to create longer viewing sessions on fake devices and quadruple the volume of traffic compared to older scams. Another scam, FM Scam, targets streaming audio and uses AI to generate fake audio traffic that looks like legitimate user activity across various devices and audio players. DoubleVerify estimated the tactic was used to spoof 500,000 devices in March 2024 and is the first instance the company has found of ad fraud targeting smart speakers. The tactics can be costly for advertisers. DoubleVerify said FM Scam is part of a larger audio ad fraud scheme called BeatSring, which is estimated to siphon traffic surpassing $1 million a month. Meanwhile, researchers say CycloneBot has been used to fake up to 250 million ad requests and spoof around 1.5 million devices each day, costing advertisers as much as $7.5 million a month. The findings come as AI is creating more concern with made-for-advertising content. In a separate report, DoubleVerify said generative AI has led to a nearly 20% increase in online MFA content, with growth largely driven by lower-tier MFA impressions on sites with both MFA and non-MFA qualities. When DoubleVerify and Sapio Research surveyed 1,000 global advertisers, 57% said they saw AI-generated content as a challenge for the digital ecosystem while 54% said generative AI has degraded media quality. AI-generated reviews can make mobile apps look like they\u2019re of interest to users while also making harmful apps look more legitimate during investigations. That\u2019s led to DoubleVerify doubling its investigations into potentially fraudulent apps in the past year. Examples from Smith include classic screen saver apps and others like an app where people leave their TV on for their pets. And how might Apple\u2019s newly announced AI tools for mobile apps and Siri further complicate the ecosystem? It\u2019s too soon to tell, said Smith, who was previously global chief product officer of investment at GroupM, the WPP-owned media agency. However, he thinks it will depend on the implementation, adding that each fraud scheme depends on different mechanisms. \u201cWe\u2019ll start looking at what the effect is of any changes in any operating system and any connectivity or data sharing between those or fake apps,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all these things, but we really want to see what it\u2019s like in production before we say if it might have the potential to do something.\u201d Misinformation flourishing alongside AI ad fraud Privacy experts and ad fraud researchers say they\u2019re not surprised to see generative AI enabling increased ad fraud. Other organizations researching generative AI\u2019s impact on ad fraud and other issues like misinformation have continued raising warnings about impending issues. At NewsGuard, researchers have been analyzing not just what generative AI means for ad fraud but also how online advertising can fuel misinformation by bad actors. \u201cWe said more than a year ago that AI was going to become a force multiplier when it comes to misinformation and disinformation,\u201d said Steven Brill, co-founder of Newsguard. \u201cThis impressive, comprehensive study by DV documents that threat in spades, as do the reports we\u2019ve done showing, for example, that one Russian disinformation operative out of Moscow is apparently responsible for 167 different hoax websites posing as real news sites and promoting content aimed at disrupting the American elections.\u201d Nearly 75% of misinformation websites relied on advertising, according to a newly published study by researchers at Newsguard, Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon. The findings, published last week in the journal Nature, also found between 46% and 82% of common advertisers inadvertently had ads served on misinformation sites. Researchers advised addressing the issue with online platforms increasing ad transparency, but that\u2019s something advertisers and consumers have spent years requesting without much progress. DoubleVerify says its own AI systems help it detect ad fraud schemes, but others doubt a surefire fix. Measurement firms have also recently faced more scrutiny over conflicts of interest when it comes to being paid by the same companies they measure and rate.

      "content": "Thursday, June 20th, 2019 \u2013 11:40 am SHARE: Uber is suing five ad networks for squandering tens of millions of dollars on low-quality or fraudulent ads \u2013 and it\u2019s naming names. The suit, filed in early June in a San Francisco court, calls out Hydrane SAS, BidMotion, Taptica, YouAppi and AdAction Interactive for purchasing \u201cnonexistent, nonviewable or fraudulent advertising.\u201d Users who did see the ads experienced pop-ups and auto-redirects as the networks gunned to get credit for app installs. Read the full complaint here. Uber first sued its agency, Dentsu\u2019s Fetch, in 2017 for allegedly buying fake clicks and taking credit for installs it didn\u2019t deserve. (Uber voluntarily withdrew its complaint in late 2018, and Fetch countersued last year for unpaid invoices, making Uber and Fetch into poster children for toxic partner relations.) This new lawsuit goes after the ad networks where Fetch placed Uber\u2019s media budgets during the same time period. What\u2019s most noteworthy about Uber\u2019s new lawsuit, other than calling out specific ad networks, is who isn\u2019t named \u2013 roughly 100 unknown companies (\u201c100 DOES\u201d) which are presumably the fraudy third-party sub-publishers that the accused ad networks partnered with to generate traffic. These John Does are \u201cpresently unknown to Uber,\u201d according to the suit, \u201cand Uber will seek leave of court to amend this complaint to allege such names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained.\u201d Hate to be cynical, but good luck with that. \u201cUber failed to get blood out of that turnip [Fetch], so they are going after the next concentric circle of (smaller) companies that can\u2019t defend themselves,\u201d said independent fraud researcher Augustine Fou. \u201cBut even this will be futile, ultimately, since those \u2018100 DOES\u2019 are literally unknown entities, so they will never get their money back.\u201d So, why is Uber even trying? Other than Uber\u2019s aborted attempt to hold Fetch accountable, this appears to be the first high-profile example of a brand suing its ad tech partners over ad fraud. Perhaps others will follow suit with suits of their own now that the seal is broken. Subscribe AdExchanger Daily Get our editors\u2019 roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Daily Roundup Daily News Roundup Cadent Gets Direct; Curating YouTube, Netflix-Style \u201cWhat is key here is simply the legal precedent set by a big marketer and the details of what they say [in the suit],\u201d said Fou. Details that amount to the anatomy of a crime that is far from unique to Uber and to the defendants in this case. Ad fraud is a story of misaligned incentives born from the murkiness of a supply chain populated by anonymous DOES mainly motivated by money \u2013 but also by the fact that most advertisers still demand volume for their campaigns while neglecting to dig into where it comes from. So, what (allegedly) happened? Uber\u2019s complaint is a classic tale of ad fraud woe. The suit alleges that the five named ad tech companies were collectively paid $70 million between 2015 and 2017 via Fetch for performance campaigns to encourage installs of the Uber app. But, according to the complaint, the inventory they bought was supposedly a bunch of junk. Some of the ads ran on sites Uber had explicitly blacklisted. The companies engaged in numerous fraudulent practices, such as click spoofing, spamming and ad stacking, and then they purposely falsified their reports to cover it all up. BidMotion/Hydrane, for example, reported to Uber in early 2017 that they purchased the majority of their ads from ad exchanges, like Twitter-owned MoPub. So, Uber asked MoPub whether the two defendants had actually bought any inventory from its exchange. MoPub said it was \u201cunaware of any such purchases.\u201d Between Q1 2016 and Q1 2017, the number of daily reported clicks on Uber ads purportedly placed by YouAppi on apps listed in YouAppi\u2019s own reporting actually exceeded the number of daily active users (DAU) of those apps, like a flashlight app with 55,430 daily clicks \u2026 and 54,735 DAUs. In another example, YouAppi, Taptica and AdAction failed to pass device IDs to TUNE, Uber\u2019s mobile attribution partner, for the majority of their alleged in-app clicks. In the same vein, although BidMotion/Hydrane claimed to only place ads on mobile apps, device ID info was almost never passed to TUNE for Uber ad placements. Nearly every attribution used a probabilistic fingerprinting method, which, the suit asserts, \u201cis far more susceptible to fraud than the deterministic method with device IDs.\u201d And so on. Uber claims that it was \u201cdiligent\u201d in overseeing the defendants\u2019 work, even devoting an internal team to oversee and monitor their activities. When Uber finally suspended its paid performance campaign in March 2017, it saw no substantial drop in the total number of app installs. Rather, the number of organic installs increased by almost the exact number by which installs attributable to mobile advertising dropped \u2013 a telltale sign that paid partners were using the last click attribution method to take credit for installs they didn\u2019t deserve. Who\u2019s to blame? When advertisers realize they\u2019ve been taken for a ride by a shady ad network, the typical course of action is to simply stop working with that network, demand a refund, dust themselves off and hopefully learn from the encounter. For its part, the ad network usually just moves on to a new, perhaps less savvy, advertiser. What\u2019s unique about this case is that Uber is taking its grievance public and identifying actual companies, which, Fou said, is \u201cabout damned time.\u201d But responsibility for the prevalence of fraud doesn\u2019t just fall at the feet of opportunistic and/or rapacious bad actors. \u201cEveryone is to blame, including the advertiser who pushed for more volume and more installs,\u201d Fou said. \u201cThe only way to get those desired volumes is through fraud \u2013 there aren\u2019t enough humans.\u201d Then again, the buck has to stop somewhere (and ideally before an advertiser is forced to demand a clawback). And ad networks that knowingly peddle worthless traffic are the worst offenders in the advertising chain after actual botnet creators, said Eric Seufert, editor of Mobile Dev Memo. These networks often clean up only after buyers start complaining, he said, another sign they know what they\u2019re doing. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that these networks are very quickly able to turn around the quality of the traffic they send you once you complain about fraud,\u201d Seufert said. Agencies, he said, are often the ones most likely to become addicted to the crack cocaine of high-volume, low-cost installs to keep their clients hooked. Companies right after they\u2019ve raised a lot of money and need to start growing quickly are also easy marks. Together, agencies and startups with more sense than money can form a continuum of willful ignorance. \u201cThe company doesn\u2019t have any internal marketing expertise, so they outsource everything to an agency and then can\u2019t evaluate the agency\u2019s work,\u201d Seufert said. What happens next? But performance marketers wary of mobile app networks still have to spend their advertising budgets \u2013 that\u2019s what they do \u2013 so where are they going to turn for inventory? Facebook and Google, of course. \u201cGoogle and Facebook are the primary beneficiaries of this fraud hysteria, which makes it all the more odd that attribution providers are the ones trying to whip everyone into a frenzy over fraud,\u201d Seufert said. \u201cThe more mobile marketing dollars that get diverted to Google and Facebook, the less necessary third-party attribution is \u2013 [and] if I was an attribution provider looking to add an ancillary revenue stream to my business, I wouldn\u2019t be trying to convince marketers that all channels except the ones that self-attribute are replete with toxic fraud.\u201d But there is an alternative to taking shelter within the walled gardens: Just be prudent and reasonable in equal measure. \u201cThere are some legitimate publishers out there with real human audiences just like there are legit mobile apps that humans actually use \u2013 advertise on those,\u201d Fou said. \u201cJust know that the quantities will be one one-hundredth of what they are today \u2026 the implication being that 99% of what we have today is fraud/fake.\u201d Uber declined to comment for this story.

      "content": "Tuesday, August 22nd, 2023 \u2013 12:45 am SHARE: Nation states exploit programmatic ad tech to attack rival countries. The prevalence of malvertising \u2013 the practice of serving ads infected with malware \u2013 is both a fact and a growing problem. The challenge is proving it. Researchers are often forced to rely on circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that a nation state is behind a malvertising campaign, which can be used to destabilize an enemy\u2019s infrastructure, sow discord during an election or a time of war and serve as a conduit for corporate sabotage. And malvertising is on the rise. According to the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG), economic uncertainty and the recent slowdown in ad spend has opened the door for malvertisers to purchase more inventory at lower prices. At the same time, hackers are becoming more familiar with programmatic infrastructure, and generative AI will only accelerate the threat of ad-served malware attacks. Fortunately, though, researchers are getting more proficient at identifying these scams, and their reports often point the finger at state actors. But how exactly do watchdogs prove that a nation state is supporting malvertising? Building a profile Earlier this year, digital safety company The Media Trust and ad platform Admixer released findings about an uptick in malvertising activity targeted at users in Ukraine that coincided with Russia\u2019s invasion. Russia has a reputation in the cybersecurity industry as a hotbed of malvertising activity, so it\u2019s logical to assume that it\u2019s responsible for at least some of the many ad scams targeting Ukrainians over the past two years. Subscribe AdExchanger Daily Get our editors\u2019 roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Daily Roundup Daily News Roundup Cadent Gets Direct; Curating YouTube, Netflix-Style (To be fair, researchers have also observed malicious ads of Ukrainian origin targeting Russians since the war began in 2022.) Beyond the timing of this increased activity, Admixer noticed a preponderance of .ru domains and Russian IP addresses associated with entities serving malware-infected ads on its network, said Yaroslav Kholod, Admixer\u2019s director of programmatic operations. But although these are all useful signals for cybersecurity researchers, said Mike Lyden, VP of threat intelligence at TAG, they don\u2019t definitively prove that the suspicious activity is government-backed. Which is why it\u2019s important for researchers to work together. Watchdogs look for commonalities between their own research and findings from other firms, Lyden said, and compare publicly shared evidence of network infiltrations. This allows them to build more detailed profiles of observed malvertising activity and get a better picture of the scope of these intrusions and the entities that are likely responsible. For example, firms create tasks forces to investigate specific \u201cadvanced persistent threats,\u201d which is how cybersecurity researchers typically refer to bad actors, including those suspected of having government support. When these groups find evidence that a network has been infiltrated by an \u201cadvanced persistent threat,\u201d they share that information with others in the research community. Malware modus operandi Researchers also run forensic analyses to stitch together a pattern of behavior and trace it back to its origin, including inspecting the infected ad creative, the landing pages that users were redirected to and any infected software they were prompted to download. Often, the malicious software itself provides a fingerprint within its code that leads back to a specific threat actor. \u201cCoders get sloppy,\u201d Lyden said. They might leave code that reflects the time zone where the software was programmed, for instance, or there could be tells that point back to the developer\u2019s mother tongue or country of origin. A malicious landing page\u2019s IP address can point to the DNS server associated with that page. Because DNS servers match domain names with their corresponding IP addresses, discovering a server used to manage an infected landing page can lead researchers to discover more infected IP addresses within the same server, said Tal Leibovich, VP of security and data at ad quality solutions provider GeoEdge. Researchers can also reverse-engineer the data transfer path between an infected landing page and the command-and-control server a scammer is using to store data stolen by malware, Leibovich said. There are several redirect hops that might occur between when a user clicks on an ad and when they arrive on the final landing page. Because this redirection infrastructure can be expensive to set up and maintain, bad actors often recycle the domains across numerous campaigns, Leibovich said. If related scams trace back to IP addresses and servers associated with a specific country, researchers can determine with reasonable confidence that the bad actors are based there. The point of the scam But how do researchers make the leap that malicious activity is being supported by that country\u2019s government? A lot depends on the purpose of the scam and the audience it targets. If malvertisers seem to be targeting government employees or sensitive national security infrastructure, odds are they aren\u2019t run-of-the-mill criminals, Lyden said. But even scams targeting everyday citizens could be government-backed. For example, Russia and Ukraine are heavily associated with ransomware attacks against financial institutions and corporate entities, said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Segura, senior director of threat intelligence at anti-malware software provider Malwarebytes. Meanwhile, threat actors in India are known for targeting older users in Western countries by serving malicious ads on recipe sites or in solitaire games. Although many such scams have been uncovered, the fact that these scammers continue to use the same tactics without major intervention on the part of their home countries suggests potential government complicity, if not outright support. It\u2019s also a red flag when governments are selective about how they crack down on bad actors. For example, they might be quick to stifle a malvertising attack on home soil but turn a blind eye to bad behavior against targets abroad. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Russian criminals develop malware to target Russian banks, and these guys didn\u2019t last very long,\u201d Segura said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re targeting American banks or European banks, that\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Some scams are also too sophisticated for most criminal enterprises to carry out without some kind of government support, Segura said. He pointed to the recently patched zero-day vulnerability in Google Chrome as an example. Although the scammers that exploited this vulnerability could have sold their methods for millions of dollars on the black market, Segura said, the fact that they didn\u2019t suggests they were being bankrolled by benefactors with deep pockets, which could point to government involvement. There is also speculation that governments knowingly allow their cybersecurity employees to conduct scams on the side to prevent talent from being poached by hacker groups. But although these observations are convincing, especially when taken altogether, they\u2019re not conclusive. Ultimately, researchers generally can\u2019t prove definitively whether a nation state is behind a malvertising attack. They can only offer estimates of probability, Lyden said. And the complexity of the advertising supply chain makes it easy for criminals to spread their activity across multiple jurisdictions, which makes it harder to prosecute, Lyden said. But collaboration and transparency among cybersecurity firms, ad tech companies, Big Tech platforms and government agencies can at least make it easier to quickly identify scams and hold those responsible accountable. \u201cStopping malvertising is really hard from a law enforcement standpoint,\u201d Lyden said. \u201cDoing so requires the industry to come together and self-regulate.\u201d Tagged in: Admixer // featured // GeoEdge // Google Chrome // J\u00e9r\u00f4me Segura // malvertising // Malwarebytes // Mike Lyden // TAG // Tal Leibovich // the media trust // Yaroslav Kholod",

      "content": "Wednesday, December 3rd, 2025 \u2013 7:25 am SHARE: Agency buyers who manage portfolios of Google Ads and Merchant Center accounts are being targeted by sophisticated scam artists who hijack those accounts, drain client funds and sometimes lock out admins for weeks or even months. That\u2019s according to three ad buyers who spoke with AdExchanger anonymously for fear of potential reprisals by Google. This problem isn\u2019t exactly new, though. The three agency execs who spoke with AdExchanger each had their accounts taken over between August and October. But similar fraudsters have been active since at least late last year, when cybersecurity business Malwarebytes first documented the issue and when an entirely different set of advertisers told AdExchanger they had suffered from account lockout attacks. Last year, the attack vector came via fraudulent Google Search links. It\u2019s a common practice \u2013 albeit a bad one \u2013 that people will type snippets like \u201cGoogle Merchant Center\u201d or \u201cgoogle account login\u201d into a search bar and then click the first result on the page. Usually, that\u2019s a sponsored or organic link that leads to the real login page. But scammers would create convincing fake Google sign-in pages and make the sponsored link text appear as \u201cads.google.com\u201d to capture traffic. When buyers inputted their username and password, they\u2019d encounter what looked like the usual two-factor authentication request, but it would actually be coming from out of the US, most often Brazil. Buyers often didn\u2019t notice and approved the two-factor login. Oops. Once the scammers get access, they lock everyone else out of the account and funnel the money back to themselves as well as spend it on phishing ads, while covering their tracks by erasing all campaign and reporting data. Phase two But the newer takeover scams reported to AdExchanger didn\u2019t come via Google Search. Two of the agency buyers said they\u2019re confident that Gmail is the root of the problem in this case. One buyer said they believe their account was likely hacked using a Gmail ad, while the other said the attack stemmed from a phishing attempt disguised as a Google Merchant Center customer service request. Subscribe AdExchanger Daily Get our editors\u2019 roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Daily Roundup Daily News Roundup Cadent Gets Direct; Curating YouTube, Netflix-Style Another theory is that the attacker seized accounts via a Salesforce integration. Google itself warned advertisers about another attack vehicle for a similar fraud strategy. An October blog post documents a cluster of \u201cthreat actors\u201d in Vietnam that were taking over Google advertiser and merchant accounts through fake job listings and ads. Those fraudsters targeted part-time, freelance or contract ad buying pros who had access to account systems on their laptop or phone. Once the malware was delivered, those accounts would be hijacked in much the same way. But, according to Google, these things happen and when they do, it deals with them. \u201cJust like consumers, our Ads customers can face threats from bad actors looking to gain access to their accounts, which is why we use advanced techniques to stay ahead of these evolving tactics,\u201d a Google spokesperson told AdExchanger. \u201cIf an account is compromised, our dedicated teams work to secure it, restore advertiser access and issue credits as necessary.\u201d What exactly is going on now? The newest iteration of Google account takeover fraud via Gmail and/or other integrations is more difficult to pin down compared to the attacks from late last year and early this year. Those were immediately and accurately diagnosed by agencies. The advertisers involved in these recent attacks were uncertain about the origin of the malware they were attacked with. As one advertiser put it to AdExchanger, the tactics used by the scammers are \u201cblack-boxed,\u201d because there is very little support or documentation forthcoming from Google about how the attackers got in or what they did in the accounts afterward. All three execs who spoke with AdExchanger said they were the ones who first alerted Google to the problem and not the other way around. Each still has client accounts their agency can\u2019t access, so they can\u2019t set up or run any new campaigns, even though the fraudsters have already been banished from those accounts. In terms of where the money went, none have been updated by Google or found evidence in their accounts. \u201cThey must know on the back end exactly where that fraudulent money was spent,\u201d one agency exec told AdExchanger. But, there\u2019s no doubt that some portion of the spend goes toward perpetuating the fraud. The next victim\u2019s malware is delivered via Google Search ads or Gmail ads, and these ads are paid for by the current victims. But all three execs have their own different theories about what else the money might have been spent on. For example, one agency buyer said an affected account had spent at least part of the client\u2019s budget on click-based ads leading to other sites, which he suspects are scammy sites where the fraudster is collecting ad spend as a publisher. None of the others have seen campaign reports or anything that documents the illicit spend. The losses It also remains unclear how many legit advertisers remain locked out of accounts. One exec whose agency was affected said they\u2019ve kept the matter hush-hush so as not to cause a stir and because \u201cwe spend a considerable amount of money with Google, so we need to walk a fine line in terms of how we deal with them.\u201d Given how much these agencies spend with Google each year \u2013 and how much they\u2019ve lost to fraudsters \u2013 you\u2019d think they\u2019d be entitled to at least basic customer service as a matter of course. But, actually, they have to work for it. The main priority for agency buyers is to protect and maintain the human customer support contacts they\u2019ve managed to make at Google through blood, sweat and tears. They\u2019re concerned that publicly complaining about the issues they\u2019re experiencing on Google\u2019s platform could leave them stuck with a cold shoulder or a chatbot that\u2019s incapable of completing a ticket. For a sense of scale, two of the agency execs claim they lost millions to fraud within their Merchant Center accounts, none of which has been refunded. Another said that because their daily budgets were relatively low, in the tens of thousands of dollars, total losses were below $1 million. However, recouping ad credits is \u201cactually secondary to getting account access back,\u201d said one exec. He added that he\u2019s confident his agency will someday recoup at least part of those fraudulently misappropriated millions in the form of ad credits once the primary issue is dealt with. Another agency leader who saw takeover scammers spend millions of dollars in client budgets said his agency spends a nine-figure sum on Google media per year. Being such a big spender has helped the agency get some human support, they said, but \u201cthere really is no way to escalate above a low-level human.\u201d Some advertisers, meanwhile, have no hope of recouping ad credits. After all, one acknowledged, these unfortunate situations do come down to user error. Someone trusted a Google Search ad or a Gmail ad and actively approved of a two-factor authentication request coming from a different country or continent. \u201cGoogle didn\u2019t let them in,\u201d one agency buyer said of the scammers. \u201cSomeone over here effed up.\u201d On the other hand, Google profits handsomely from the situation. Not only are scammers using Google\u2019s platform tools to buy Google media, brands refill their accounts with more ad budget. In fact, all three agency execs said they\u2019ve mostly already covered their clients\u2019 losses. If Google refunds an agency or advertiser, it does so only in part and only in the form of Google ad credits. Which is related to what one agency exec said is the most frustrating aspect of account takeover fraud. Months after the account takeovers were first reported to Google and the fraudsters were booted out with all new passwords, logins and two-factor credentials, one of the agency execs that AdExchanger spoke to said their business remains \u201cfrozen\u201d with some of its most important clients. \u201cThe lack of urgency on [Google\u2019s] part has been pretty crazy,\u201d they added.

      "content": "Thursday, January 16th, 2025 \u2013 1:47 pm SHARE: Multiple different criminal rings around the world are orchestrating surgical phishing scams that target ad industry media buyers. Specifically, fraudsters are duping ad buyers who log into Google Ads after running a Google search. The scammers serve fraudulent sponsored search links to these ad executives, and then hack into their accounts and use their funds to serve even more phishing ads and to run fraudulent click-based ad campaigns, thus funneling some of the funds back to themselves. Three major Google Search and Merchant Center account operators \u2013 two agency buyers and a consultant \u2013 separately told AdExchanger that their systems had been infiltrated in December. Jerome Segura, senior director of research at Malwarebytes, published a report documenting the same scam operations on Wednesday. He estimates that thousands of Google Ads account owners have been hit by the scam. How it works The Google Ads accounts are being hacked in an audacious way. By scammers who are placing their own search ads for queries related to setting up or logging into Google Ads. Sometimes, rather than going directly to a particular website or login page, people will just write, perhaps, \u201cFacebook,\u201d \u201cESPN fantasy,\u201d or \u201cGoogle Ads\u201d in their browser URL. Then they click on the search result at the top of the page. When you use this approach, querying \u201cGoogle Ads\u201d to log into your account, a quick click on the URL can turn out to be a huge mistake. A mistake which many ad-buying executives have recently discovered to their dismay. In short, someone at an agency or ad-buying firm uses Google search results as the on-ramp to their Google Ads login. Except they click on the sponsored link that\u2019s identical to a typical promoted link for Google Ads in the search results, with a matching URL that still reads ads.google.com. That link redirects to a phishing page posing as the Google Ads login page. The person inputs their email and password. The potential tripwire is two-factor authentication. One advertiser who personally fell for this phishing scam told AdExchanger that they received the familiar authentication request upon signing in, but that the request said it was a login coming from Brazil, whereas usually it pins exactly on their location. The person said they attributed it perhaps to something weird with the Wi-Fi they were using or the company\u2019s VPN. Regardless, they approved the sign-in request, believing they were the one signing in. Subscribe AdExchanger Daily Get our editors\u2019 roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Daily Roundup Daily News Roundup Cadent Gets Direct; Curating YouTube, Netflix-Style After the account takeover, the criminals immediately added themselves as an admin and began creating new campaigns that were \u201ceffectively camouflaged as our own campaigns,\u201d they said. These new campaigns paid for more of the Google Search ads that spread the malware to begin with. One source said budgets were also spent on other click-based ads, likely on a site operated by the scammers, as a way to earn money on the operation. It\u2019s hard to tell, he said, because the scammers wiped the data on those campaigns. The hackers were also very experienced in the Google Ads system, sources said. After getting admin access to one agency\u2019s merchant and search center, which they operate for many brand accounts, the hackers targeted accounts with the largest wallets available and where their campaigns might be best disguised. \u201cIt was very quick,\u201d said one source who observed the setup of campaigns after the account takeover, \u201cbut also showed human thoughtfulness, not just programmatic software.\u201d (\u201cProgrammatic\u201d in the sense of being fully automated, not with a person in control.) All three sources AdExchanger spoke to were targeted by hackers seemingly operating out of Brazil. Segura of Malwarebytes documents another ring likely in Asia \u2013 China or Hong Kong \u2013 and a third he guesses is based in Eastern Europe, though it\u2019s unclear. Has it stopped? Even this week, there are new reports of the same ads with the same malicious code being spread via Google Search sponsored links, two sources told AdExchanger. Google has released this statement on the matter: \u201cWe expressly prohibit ads that aim to deceive people in order to steal their information or scam them. Our teams are actively investigating this issue and working quickly to address it.\u201d However, \u201cprohibit\u201d is a loose term. Things that are prohibited happen all the time. Some of the advertisers operating these campaigns weathered dozens of reports of them being phishing scams before they were suspended. Segura writes that his team reported more than 50 incidents involving the same ad account conducting this fraud over the course of a few days in December, but were unable to win the game of Whac-A-Mole. \u201cWe quickly realized that no matter how many reported incidents and takedowns, the threat actors managed to keep at least one malicious ad 24/7,\u201d he writes. AdExchanger\u2019s sources also said it was their own system that identified their account hacks, not Google Ads spotting the problem. And that they had to sometimes report the same account or malicious ad campaign repeatedly. What about the money? Whenever agencies and ad-buying consultants have some accounts hacked or budgets emptied by fraudsters, there are awkward questions: Who is on the hook for the lost money? And this is a particularly uncomfortable discussion between Google, agent and advertiser. After all, it very much was human error on the part of the agencies, consultants and direct advertisers who were targeted by this scam. But the fraudsters did happen to be Google Ads aficionados, based on their keen expertise with the system, and were using Google Search as their vehicle for fraud. The three sources who spoke to AdExchanger said their businesses immediately offered reimbursements to clients. They are also following up with Google. Each affected party said Google is offering reimbursements once the company sends information documenting the hack and commits to certain account security standards moving forward. Another awkward factor in this hack is that the Google Ads scam may not be the point. The scammers, after all, don\u2019t empty account wallets into their own pockets. What the hacks seem to do primarily is spread malware further by paying for more fraudulent Google Search links. The malware prompts a download to the device. So there is a concern that the affected devices might be tapped again for other purposes as part of a malware network. Selling Google Ads account credentials is also a lucrative black market dealing, according to Segura. \u201cWe believe their goal is to resell those accounts on black hat forums, while also keeping some to themselves to perpetuate these campaigns.\u201d The best prevention advertisers can take is to \u2026 stop using Google Search as an entry point to the login portal. The exec who told AdExchanger they had fallen for the trick said they\u2019d always clicked the sponsored link atop the Google Search page. Why? \u201cI vented a little frustration with Google each time,\u201d they said. \u201cBy making them pay a bit for every time I logged on.\u201d Tagged in: ad fraud // featured // Malwarebytes",

AdMonsters: While investigating BADBOX 1, HUMAN discovered a new round of fraud, which you\u2019re calling BADBOX 2.0. What is BADBOX 2.0, and how does it differ from the original BADBOX? GR: BADBOX 2.0 is a significant expansion and adaptation of the original BADBOX operation, which we first uncovered in 2023. When we investigated BADBOX 1, we saw a more straightforward structure in which a single backdoor, known as Triada, was used to infect devices. This malware was pre-installed on devices at the manufacturing stage. Having one backdoor made it easier to spot and disrupt. It was relatively straightforward in its operation, and fewer devices and device types were involved. AdMonsters: I remember talking to Lindsey Kaye about BADBOX, and it didn\u2019t seem that straightforward. It sounded like a sophisticated scheme by the threat actors to obfuscate their activities. GR: That\u2019s true, but BADBOX 2.0 is far more complex and widespread. The threat actors have expanded their fraud operation, targeting various devices\u2014off-brand, uncertified Android Open Source Project (AOSP) devices. These included connected TV boxes, tablets, and even aftermarket car infotainment systems. What makes BADBOX 2.0 different is the sheer scale and diversity of the devices infected. Instead of a single malware type, we\u2019re now dealing with hundreds of different variants, which makes it harder to spot and disrupt. AdMonsters: Are the threat actors using the same methods in BADBOX 2.0 as they did in BADBOX GR: BADBOX 2.0 is a much more sophisticated and targeted operation than BADBOX 1. The threat actors have significantly adapted and expanded their methods. One key difference is the diversification of their attack strategies. They no longer rely on one factory backdoor and have added drive-by downloads or infected apps from third-party app stores. They\u2019ve also increased the sophistication of their malware, deploying multiple variants and using new tactics to disguise their activities, which makes it harder to spot. Beyond the typical programmatic ad fraud seen in BADBOX 1, we\u2019re now also seeing click fraud, where infected devices generate fake clicks on ads, driving up advertisers' costs. In addition, the scope of the operation has grown substantially. Over a million devices are affected now, compared to just around 70,000 with BADBOX 1. This growth highlights how much more widespread and effective the operation has become. The fraud itself is also more advanced. Beyond the typical programmatic ad fraud seen in BADBOX 1, we\u2019re now also seeing click fraud, where infected devices generate fake clicks on ads, driving up advertisers\u2019 costs. Like in BADBOX 1, these devices are still being used for residential proxy services, which allow cybercriminals to disguise their activities behind what appears to be legitimate user traffic. AdMonsters: Can you walk us through some of the scams and fraud tactics used in BADBOX 2.0? How does it affect advertisers and publishers? GR: Similar to BADBOX 1, the infected devices are still used for residential proxy services, allowing cybercriminals to hide their activities behind legitimate user traffic. There\u2019s also a significant component where they\u2019re directing traffic to H5 game sites. If you visit one of these sites, the games are nearly impossible to play. But, in the background, these infected devices automatically play these games and generate revenue for the criminals. BADBOX 2.0 also lets the threat actors engage in serious fraud beyond ad scams. The residential proxy network they\u2019ve built up can be used by other bad actors for things like account takeovers, where they steal access to people\u2019s online accounts, or fake account creation, where they set up bogus profiles for fraudulent purposes. They can also use this network to steal credentials, exfiltrate sensitive information, and even launch DDoS attacks. These activities are typically carried out by downstream criminals who purchase access to the proxy services provided by the infected devices. This allows them to hide their tracks, making it much harder to trace their criminal activities back to the source. It\u2019s not just hundreds of thousands; the scale of the fraud is much larger, affecting advertisers and publishers across the board. AdMonsters: What\u2019s a residential proxy service? GR: A residential proxy network is essentially a network of infected devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or connected TVs, that are used by threat actors to disguise their fraudulent activities. When a device is compromised through something like the BADBOX 2.0 malware, it becomes part of this network, allowing the attackers to route malicious traffic through the device. For the consumer, there\u2019s no immediate indication that anything is wrong. They continue using the device as usual, watching TV or using apps, but the device is being used in the background to carry out fraud. This could involve generating fake clicks on ads, committing click fraud, or enabling other criminal activities. The main issue is that the device is essentially used to assist in fraudulent activities without the owner\u2019s knowledge or consent. AdMonsters: Where are these attacks occurring? Are they in the U.S.? GR: We discovered that BADBOX 2.0 has a significant global presence, with infected devices found across 222 countries and territories, including the U.S. While there is significant activity in the U.S., the highest concentration of infections is in Latin America, particularly in Brazil. This indicates that while the threat is widespread, the real volume of attacks is centered in Latin America. AdMonsters: How much money are advertisers losing to this scheme? GR: I can\u2019t provide specific numbers. I can tell you it\u2019s a significant amount. We\u2019re talking millions of dollars over the entire campaign. It\u2019s not just hundreds of thousands; the scale of the fraud is much larger, affecting advertisers and publishers across the board. AdMonsters: It sounds like fighting such a widespread fraud operation requires substantial collaboration. Who are your partners in disrupting BADBOX 2.0, and how are these partnerships helping combat the fraud? GR: We\u2019re working closely with several trusted partners, including Google, Trend Micro, The Shadowserver Foundation, and various law enforcement agencies. These collaborations allow us to share intelligence, disrupt the infrastructure powering these attacks, and protect consumers and businesses from fraud. I should emphasize that the investigation and the scheme are ongoing. AdMonsters: What role do cheap, off-brand devices play in this scheme? What are they particularly vulnerable to infection? GR: Cheap, off-brand devices are particularly vulnerable to infection because they often come with minimal security and quality controls. These devices, especially those running uncertified Android Open Source Project (AOSP) versions, are more likely to be sold with pre-installed malware or are susceptible to being compromised through drive-by downloads or apps from third-party app stores. And because they don\u2019t have regular security updates and certifications, once a backdoor is installed, it\u2019s far more challenging for consumers to detect or protect against it. What\u2019s alarming is that many consumers may not even think twice about purchasing these cheaper devices, especially when they offer features that seem too good to pass up, like low prices or access to free content. But the reality is that these devices are often sold with little regard for security or future updates, making them prime targets for these kinds of fraud operations. AdMonsters: That\u2019s an interesting point. We may not think twice about spending a little more on a secure tablet, but we might be more willing to purchase a cheap, off-brand connected TV without realizing the potential risks. How can consumers better protect themselves from this kind of fraud? GR: The first and most important step is awareness. Consumers need to recognize that, just like with smartphones or tablets, the quality and security of connected devices\u2014especially off-brand ones\u2014matter. Everyone should be cautious when purchasing devices from unfamiliar or unverified brands. Look for Play Protect certified devices with built-in security features like regular software updates, firewalls, and encryption. If a device seems too good to be true, it often is, so making informed decisions is crucial rather than focusing solely on price. We should also be cautious about downloading apps from third-party sources. The safest approach is to stick to trusted marketplaces and be wary of deals that seem overly discounted. ### About Gavin Reid Gavin Reid serves as the CISO for HUMAN Security, a cybersecurity company that specializes in safeguarding enterprises from digital attacks while preserving digital experiences for users.

      "content": "Malvertising surged 10% in 2024, with forced redirects dominating attacks and over 70% of users now viewing online ads as untrustworthy, underscoring the urgent need for stronger ad security measures across the industry. Every season, malvertising mutates, revealing new tactics designed to evade detection and inflict harm across the digital advertising ecosystem. From deceptive redirects to sophisticated phishing schemes, these evolving threats continue to wreak havoc\u2014damaging victims, tarnishing the reputations of publishers and brands and undermining trust in the entire ad ecosystem. Each year, we analyze over one trillion impressions across premium websites, apps, and SSPs to track emerging threats. By sharing our findings, we aim to equip the broader industry with the knowledge needed to safeguard readers, customers, and reputations. The 2024 Ad Quality Report found that over 70% of users now perceive at least half of online ads as untrustworthy\u2014a trend fueled by a 10% year-over-year surge in malvertising levels in 2024. Malvertisers are increasingly exploiting social engineering tactics to deceive users, with holiday shopping events like Thanksgiving and Black Friday fueling a surge in clickbait scams. Let\u2019s look at some of the key highlights. Forced Redirects Dominate Forced redirects were the dominant attack method throughout 2024 (in October, these attacks accounted for 81% of all malicious ads). Unlike traditional scams that rely on user engagement, forced redirects automatically send users to malicious landing pages without requiring a click. These attacks often appear as fake pop-ups, deceptive security alerts, or fraudulent prize notifications, particularly targeting mobile users where security protections tend to be weaker. Q4\u2019s Perfect Storm for Malvertising The final quarter of 2024 created ideal conditions for fraudsters, combining peak online shopping with heightened user urgency around Black Friday and holiday deals. Clickbait schemes offering misleading product offers (31%), tech support scams (23%), and financial scams (22%) were the leading themes. Malvertisers served the lion\u2019s share of these scams in the United States. Geographic Targeting and Platform Specifics North America remained the primary battleground for forced redirects, with 55% of malicious ads in the U.S. and Canada originating from forced redirection attacks. While these attacks were present globally, they were significantly less common in Europe (30%) and APAC (32%). However, the most striking regional difference lies in the sheer volume of malicious ads served. In the U.S., one out of every 160 ads was malicious, which is a slight improvement from 2023. Canada was a high-risk region, with one out of every 75 ads being malicious (a far worse ratio than most other markets). Meanwhile, Japan saw far lower exposure, with just one malicious ad per 1,295 impressions. Mobile devices account for 56% of malicious ad traffic, primarily through forced redirects (68% of mobile attacks). Desktop users face more clickbait scams \u2013 79% of these target desktop devices, likely because users are more willing to engage with text-heavy scam articles on larger screens. Mobile redirects succeed more often since they\u2019re harder for the user to identify as a scan on mobile devices. Supply-Side Platform Security Performance We saw some concerning shifts in SSP quality throughout the year. Some platforms, including Google, improved markedly, while others became more vulnerable. For instance, the third-largest SSP experienced a substantial increase in malvertising rates, exceeding 10%. Open marketplaces consistently showed higher vulnerability than their private counterparts, highlighting the critical need for enhanced demand pipeline screening Content Blocking Trends and Regional Variations Gambling remained the most blocked content category globally, with regional variations in restrictions. In the U.S., weapons-related content ranked as the second most blocked category, while APAC publishers focused more on restricting tobacco-related ads. Mobile gaming ads also saw increased filtering, particularly in APAC, due to concerns over violent and inappropriate content, with publishers increasingly leveraging app store category-based blocking. The Role of Advanced Targeting ScamClub and similar groups deployed sophisticated fingerprinting and cloaking methods to bypass detection systems. This year, we saw, for the first time, a massive penetration of auto-redirects through video ads, not just display. These tactics proved especially effective on mobile, where forced redirects exploit both the limited screen space and users\u2019 mobile browsing habits. With mobile users less likely to notice suspicious redirects, these attacks saw higher success rates than desktop platforms. Looking Ahead The surge in malicious activity over the past year reinforces the need for publishers and platforms to take a holistic approach to securing their assets across web, in-app, and CTV ads. While many have implemented stronger ad verification and security measures, the industry\u2019s response remains uneven \u2014 some platforms have made significant progress in reducing malvertising, while others continue to struggle. As malvertising fraud evolves with every season, the real winners in ad quality will be those who proactively protect users wherever they engage. Moving into 2025, success will require stronger industry-wide coordination, with publishers, platforms, and ad security partners working together and investing in both technology and user education to stay ahead of emerging threats.

      "content": "Tuesday, December 16th, 2025 \u2013 12:03 am SHARE: Meet The Experts Reuters has another groundbreaking scoop on Meta\u2019s scam advertising economy. Internal documents estimate more than $3 billion in 2024 spent by Chinese advertisers on scams or other illicit and banned ads. That\u2019s about a fifth of Meta\u2019s ad revenue from China. The documents show the number was cut in half over the course of the year, but the team responsible for those changes was disassembled. Last month, Reuters reported that about a tenth of Meta\u2019s entire revenue last year came from such scams or illicit ad spend. Meta blocked relatively few advertisers who perpetrated scams, but it did charge many scammer accounts higher ad pricing floors. Another interesting note \u2013 for marketers to learn from and for social media users to be wary of \u2013 is that scammers tend to be very good at using different parts of a platform together. Meta scammers, for instance, are adept at luring Facebook users to WhatsApp groups where they pose as investment advisors, say. Similarly, Google scammers are great at cross-leveraging Google Search, Gmail, Google Merchant Center and other parts of the Googleverse into one effective scam marketing funnel. Getting Prompt Results Every once in a while, a little window offers a peek into an otherwise opaque black box \u2013 and right now, that window is peering into AI prompt data. Analytics and marketing intelligence firms like Profound, Semrush and Similarweb are developing new tools for publishers to track how AI systems refer to their content. But until AI platforms and tech companies publicly share this AI data themselves, \u201cthe methodology is always going to be questionable,\u201d Lily Ray, VP of SEO strategy and research at performance marketing agency Amsive, told Digiday. Most of the analytics firms use APIs to mimic prompts and assess the results, or buy clickstream data from a Chrome extension. And since AI responds to individualized queries, rather than specific keywords like in SEO, these firms aren\u2019t seeking out results for a specific prompt. \u201cThere\u2019s no value in that,\u201d according to Semrush President Eugene Levin. Instead, they aggregate prompts to create broad categories and see what shows up in the results. Semrush is also developing a tool that shows how many site visits were influenced by AI platforms. Hopefully, the results are enough to help publishers understand what drives consumers to click a link. Because the publishers getting the most traffic are the ones who have the most leverage in striking a deal with the AI companies. Reliable Service Telco conquest marketing is officially getting out of hand. The category already exists deep in the borderlands of acceptability, as The Wall Street Journal reports. There is a rich history of wireless providers making claims about their rivals\u2019 services, to be disputed by the National Advertising Division (the NAD, a division of the BBB National Programs). A recent escalation started with a Verizon \u201cBring Your Bill\u201d campaign asking T-Mobile and AT&T customers to bring a bill and receive a counter-offer. T-Mobile responded in kind with an \u201cEasy Switch\u201d campaign asking Verizon or AT&T customers to provide password and login info to receive personalized competitive offers. This jockeying for customers \u201ckicked off a technical cat-and-mouse game\u201d in which AT&T tried to block T-Mobile\u2019s software. Now, AT&T is suing T-Mobile to forbid the practice and delete all data collected. A recent ad produced by AT&T takes the meta-competition even further, featuring Luke Wilson reading a newspaper headlined \u201cT-MOBILE MOST CHALLENGED FOR DECEPTIVE ADS.\u201d T-Mobile said the AT&T ad is deceptive. AT&T was forced to pull the ad, though, because an NAD policy forbids \u201cusing the ad-challenge process itself for promotional purposes.\u201d But Wait!

Digital spend in China is predicted by eMarketer to grow from $40.4 billion in 2016 to $83.6 billion in 2020. But the growth may be limited by ad fraud. According to ad firm AdMaster\u2019s stats from more than 500 Chinese advertisers, on average around 28 percent of a digital campaign\u2019s traffic was not seen by a human being during the first half of 2016, and the number of fraudulent traffic could go up to 95 percent for some campaigns. \u201cThere\u2019s no single country immune to ad fraud, but unfortunately it\u2019s a bigger problem in China,\u201d said Ronen Mense, vp of Asia for mobile analytics company AppsFlyer. Ad fraud can take various forms, from impressions and clicks generated by bots, to fake websites stuffed with the highest-priced keywords to attract search ads. But the most severe ad fraud practice in China occurs when ads are placed around inappropriate content like pornography and violence. Publishers and ad networks \u2014 big or small \u2014 typically use this trick when they cannot reach certain key performance indicators, according to Marin Zhang, CEO for ad verification service Adbug. Foreign ad verification companies can hardly identify \u201cunsafe content\u201d because some issues like food safety and anti-Japanese sentiment are specific to China, he said. While Zhang found that many display ads\u2019 viewability is less than 5 percent, most advertisers in China are still using ad tracking instead of working with third-party companies to evaluate each click or impression, because everyone wants to make the numbers look good on the paper. \u201cAd tracking is a weak technology in detecting fraud. But brands and agencies feel scared to work with ad-verification services,\u201d said Zhang. \u201cThe question is: Do you want to report back to the headquarters with strong KPIs even though they are fake, or verified ones showing that all of your historical campaigns are shit?\u201d Mense echoed the same sentiment, adding that while there\u2019s a mature ad validation system in the U.S., publishers and advertisers in China like striking direct deals without having any validation services involved. And many ad-tracking tools are data-management platforms as well, meaning that they can manipulate campaign metrics. When it comes to mobile specifically, there are more than 200 app stores in China while there are just two major app stores \u2014 Google and Apple \u2014 in the States. \u201cThe Chinese mobile market is much more fragmented,\u201d he said. \u201cThose app stores can easily fake installs.\u201d But there\u2019s optimism. Zhang believes that 2017 will the biggest year for brand safety and viewability in China. Mobile Marketing Association China set up a brand safety and viewability standard group last week, hoping to come up with industry standards and solutions to ad fraud. The initial 20 members include executives from Tencent, Procter & Gamble, and Zhang. \u201cIn China, there are different parties at agencies internally competing for ad budgets. Some hate us, while some like us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe global push for transparency influences the Chinese market.

This time, there\u2019s accountability. Two global botnets, Methbot and 3ve, are no more, and there are real people facing charges. On Tuesday, the Department of Justice unsealed indictments against eight men from Russia and Kazakhstan accused of running the schemes, which collectively sucked millions of dollars out of the advertising ecosystem over several years. Three of the accused perpetrators are awaiting extradition, and the remaining five are still at large. They\u2019ve been charged with 13 counts, including money laundering, wire fraud, computer intrusion and aggravated identity theft. [Read the indictment here.] The Federal Bureau of Investigation collaborated with White Ops, Google and a group of other ad tech companies to dismantle the operations. Methbot was shut down in December 2016, close to the time White Ops went public with the more than 4,000 compromised IP addresses involved in the plot. The 3ve botnet, which exploited a combination of counterfeit websites, malware, a fake ad network and seats on legit exchanges to do its bidding, was dismantled in October. (Fun fact: \u201c3ve,\u201d pronounced \u201cEve,\u201d is a portmanteau of \u201cthree,\u201d for the three sub-operations within 3ve, and the word \u201cevasion.\u201d Buzzfeed has a detailed report on 3ve\u2019s crackdown.) But the consequences of this ad fraud campaign are different, said White Ops CEO Sandeep Swadia: \u201cThere are handcuffs involved.\u201d But why now and why is the DOJ interested in this case? Ad fraud has been plaguing the ad industry since the Internet was born. It came down to two factors: actionable data and a willingness to act, said Tamer Hassan, CTO and co-founder of White Ops. After White Ops published its paper on Methbot in 2016, federal law enforcement decided it had enough data and materials for the FBI Cyber Division to start tracking other ad fraud operations.

That is TBD,\u201d Swadia said. \u201cBut there are so many downstream possibilities that curbing that flow of money to these guys is the most important thing. That\u2019s why the DOJ was very keenly involved in doing this at a global level.\u201d Another motivator was the \u201csheer sophistication and ambition\u201d of the 3ve fraud scheme, which was \u201cmetastasizing across the entire ecosystem,\u201d Swadia said. Shutting down Methbot was a matter of publishing IP addresses to blacklist, but the 3ve case required bigger guns. Simply shutting it down would have tipped off the perps. That\u2019s why killing 3ve required a coordinated effort between the FBI, cybersecurity experts and the ad industry. And now that there\u2019s a real deterrent against ad fraud, the ad industry has one of the most important tools it was missing to win the war against ad fraud. \u201cThe key here is having consequences,\u201d said Per Bjorke, a product manager for ad traffic quality at Google, who worked closely with the DOJ and White Ops on the takedown. \u201cPeople are going to now think twice, because they could end up getting arrested and extradited out of their country.\u201d And now that the ball is rolling, we could see more activity in the year to come, said Amy King, VP of product marketing at fraud detection company Pixalate. \u201cThis case sets a precedent for holding fraudsters accountable,\u201d King said, \u201cWe believe there will be more to come in 2019.\u201d The DOJ did not respond to questions in time for publication.

More from the series \u2192 First off, few readers will need reminding how the remedies phase of Google\u2019s ad tech trial kicks off next week. After the widespread disappointment of the earlier ruling in the parallel search trial, Digiday wants your opinion on what the most likely opinion will be, so please share your opinion in a quick poll here \u2013 it will take less than a minute of your time. That brings us to the topic of ad fraud, an activity that came to mainstream attention with news of convictions for such activity in the early 2020s. However, as today\u2019s report from cybersecurity firm HUMAN shows, it\u2019s not a problem that\u2019s gone away. Earlier today, it disclosed details of what it characterizes as one of the more sophisticated mobile ad fraud operations uncovered to date. HUMAN uncovers \u2018SlopAds\u2019 The scheme, dubbed \u201cSlopAds,\u201d relied on hundreds of apps distributed via Google Play and generated billions of fraudulent bid requests before its takedown, with the firm unable to share estimates of how much it cost advertisers. The latest SlopAds investigation involved at least 224 apps collectively downloaded more than 38 million times across 228 countries, with much of this activity originating in the United States, India and Brazil, per the company. At its height, the network generated an estimated 2.3 billion daily bid requests, according to HUMAN\u2019s technical report, with the \u201cSlop\u201d moniker reflecting both the mass-produced nature of the apps and their recurring AI-themed branding, a veneer that belied the underlying mechanics. An extensive infrastructure of command-and-control servers and promotional domains supported the apps. How the scheme worked SlopAds went beyond conventional click fraud. Once downloaded, the apps performed checks to avoid detection, distinguishing between organic and non-organic installs. Fraudulent behavior only triggered if an app had been downloaded after a user clicked on an ad. In practice, that meant the app behaved benignly for users who installed it directly, but activated hidden modules for those who arrived via ads. The fraud module, dubbed FatModule, was delivered through digital steganography. Four PNG image files concealed fragments of code that, when reassembled on a device, executed the fraud logic. The apps also deployed anti-analysis techniques such as debugging checks, string encryption and packed native code. From there, the operation relied on hidden WebViews, stripped-down browsers that collected device data and navigated to \u201ccashout\u201d domains controlled by the threat actors. These WebViews rendered ads and auto-clicked them, with repeated redirects sanitizing referral data to simulate legitimate traffic. In some cases, the fraud targeted HTML5 game and news websites, echoing tactics seen in other operations like BADBOX 2.0. Buyer blind spots HUMAN described SlopAds\u2019 use of attribution and measurement tools as a novel obfuscation tactic. By piggybacking on attribution tags, the apps could confirm whether an install was organic or not without writing custom tools. In an email exchange, Lindsay Kaye, vp of threat intelligence, HUMAN, told Digiday the technique did not involve compromising SDKs. Instead, the bad actors involved leveraged attribution, highlighting how legitimate systems can be co-opted. Asked whether buyers should question the reliability of attribution platforms, Kaye replied, \u201cThe exploitation of the attribution system by SlopAds was not done in such a way that it should make buyers question the reliability of the tool. Rather, the threat actors used it in its intended fashion.\u201d Platform response As for which sell-side or demand-side platforms were most exposed, HUMAN declined to disclose details, although Kaye claimed media teams should encourage partners in their ad tech supply chain to use more sophisticated tools to detect invalid traffic. Google removed all identified SlopAds apps from its Play Store, according to HUMAN, with Android\u2019s Play Protect security service now blocking apps exhibiting similar behaviors, although it claimed the scheme involved tens of millions of downloads before removal. \u201cHUMAN not only provides this filtration, but also surfaces granular insights into specific supply that may indicate quality concerns,\u201d added Kaye. Next steps HUMAN researchers said they expect the operators of SlopAds to adapt and redeploy, given the investment in infrastructure and indications that they were testing new apps even during the investigation. The company said it continues to monitor for further activity. The broader takeaway for advertisers is that fraud tactics are increasingly conditional, sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from legitimate traffic. SlopAds shows that threat actors are willing to borrow tools from the legitimate ad tech stack \u2014 from attribution to steganography \u2014 to cloak their operations. For buyers, this raises questions not just about fraud detection, but about how much confidence to place in the signals underpinning programmatic decisions. While HUMAN clients were insulated, industry-wide exposure remains unclear, underscoring the asymmetry of information between security vendors and buyers. As fraudsters adapt, the SlopAds case highlights a familiar but intensifying theme: programmatic buying remains an attractive target, and bad actors are hiding in plain sight as AI slop becomes more commonplace.

This reclassification penalizes SSPs by scoring their inventory as less efficient, diverting ad spend to The Trade Desk\u2019s direct supply paths. While aiming to cut inefficiencies, critics argue it consolidates The Trade Desk\u2019s control, reducing money for some SSPs and publishers, though others benefit from favored integrations like OpenPath. This shift is reshaping industry dynamics. Netflix turns to Amazon to make its ads easier to buy Netflix will sell ads via Amazon\u2019s DSP in 12 markets, completing programmatic integration. Amazon\u2019s commerce data offers advertisers unique targeting power, while discounted fees strengthen its appeal.

With GAM going direct to buyers, SPO is the new normal Adexchanger riffs on an earlier story by The Information, looking at Google\u2019s sell-side business, a.k.a. Google Ad Manager, pursuit of direct deals with the buy side \u2013 the implication being that demand-side platforms, including Google\u2019s own DV360, would be cut out. GAM representatives recently hosted a dinner for top ad agencies in New York City in July to discuss ways that GAM could work directly with buyers. Is Google preparing to make Its ad tech biz independent? Emarketer\u2019s analyst team does likewise, instead explaining how Google\u2019s preparations reflect regulatory pressure following Judge Brinkema\u2019s April ruling that it holds an illegal monopoly over publisher ad servers and ad exchanges. Regulators might force Google to divest GAM or sell its AdX exchange to increase competition. Despite a 7% revenue decline in network revenue, Google remains dominant with $205 billion forecasted ad revenues for 2025, but its slowed growth and antitrust challenges threaten industry dynamics and competitors.

TrafficGuard/Juniper estimate that one in 13 app installs are fraudulent globally These are just the most important data points that describe the current state of digital ad fraud, both on the web and mobile. Further on we\u2019ll be presenting memorable examples of ad fraud, estimates for ad fraud cost, impact by region, app category and mobile OS, ad fraud detection, countermeasures, and more. High-profile examples of ad fraud A massive botnet operation called 3ve was dismantled in November 2018. The stats that reveals details of this operation will be, quite frankly, frightening to digital advertisers (though it should be noted this is an extreme example, being one of the biggest such operations ever discovered). It consisted of three operations, says the WFA: hijacked IP addresses, counterfeit sites, and inventory and data centre traffic. 1.7 million PCs were infected by malware, 10,000 fake sites were generating 3-12 billion daily bid requests (impersonating legitimate publishers), and over 60,000 seller IDs with digital companies to enable fraudsters to receive ad placements and be paid accordingly. Google reported in a whitepaper that the network had been hard to detect, as it deployed tactics such as counter ad fraud manipulation and evasion, and the ability to change its codebase after spikes in usage. It is thought that 3ve cost businesses a whopping $29 million in ad spend. Along with Methbot (ran by the same fraudsters), the Russian defendants were accused of defrauding businesses out of $36 million in all. None of the ads involved in this fraud ring were ever viewed by a human being. A report published by Juniper Research reveals 22% of all digital advertising spend in 2023 was attributed to fraud, which is a whopping $84 billion and this is not the worst news, thus number, if a current trend will continue, is projected to reach $172 billion by 2028. Massive amounts of digital ad fraud can be carried out through a single conduit. For example, Pixalate reported in June 2018 that an app named MegaCast \u2013 Chrome Player served as a front for an operation through which as much as $75 million worth of ad fraud was enabled. This utilized an increasingly-prevalent form of mobile ad fraud: app laundering which relies heavily on bundle ID spoofing. Pixalate found that if a device was on for 24 hours it would \u2018serve\u2019 1,400 impressions, a 6:4 mixture of display to video. Potential cost of ad fraud carried out through Megacast \u2013 Chrome Player per device ($) Source: Pixalate Notably, in the aforementioned report from Buzzfeed, it was noted that after fraudulent schemes came to light it was very hard for journalists to get hold of specific numbers from actors along the supply chain. This meant it was very difficult to investigate the movement of money. Why this secrecy? Such companies presumably operate in fear of being found negligent, or in extreme cases, complicit. Some sources believe the actual amount stolen in above mentioned may well be as high as hundreds of millions of dollars in reality. Only a tiny proportion of companies contacted by Buzzfeed stated any intention to return money. This issue, experts say, is endemic, with something of a tacit acceptance that a certain amount of money will be lost to fraud. US Senator Mark Warner (vice chair of the US Senate Intelligence Committee) sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission in October 2018, raising his concerns over high levels of digital ad fraud, in the wake of Buzzfeed\u2019s expos\u00e9. In this letter he accused Google and other major platforms of inaction and even wilful blindness to the scale of ad fraud, while continuing to happily pocket the revenue. Google removed 30 apps from the Play Store in the wake of Buzzfeed\u2019s article. Anti-fraud consultant and research Dr Augustine Fou posits in an interview with Forbes that it would not be in the interests of ad agencies for ad fraud to be resolved. Cutting out the problem would have the effect of vastly reducing the amount of \u201cavailable\u201d inventory. It would also be difficult for marketers who have been working under the impression that there is a good deal more impressions out there for the taking than is actually the case. It would take a wholescale rethink, in which our understanding of what constitutes as good numbers would have to recalibrated. This might make for painful reading for marketers, given click-though rates in reality would be somewhere in the realm of 0.1%. KPIs the world over would have to be roundly revised downwards. Or, we might simply measure different results, though Fou warns that bots can also fake conversions\u2026 The more recent example of an online ad fraud is the 2021 case of LeoTerra \u2013 the server-side ad insertion online fraud scheme. In a nutshell, the ad fraud scheme was about spoofing, at its peak, 20+ million connected TVs per day to deceive advertisers to believe they were provided with a CTV ad inventory on a massive scale. To put it in perspective, in 2020 the same scheme was generating 20x less volume of spoofed CTVs, which is to say this kind of ad fraud scheme has been growing rapidly. Cost of ad fraud Estimates of the total scale and cost of ad fraud vary hugely, due to the complexity of ascertaining the volume of invalid traffic/downloads. Back in 2016, the World Federation of Advertisers predicted that, within a decade, ad fraud and other fake internet traffic schemes would become the second-biggest market for organized crime after the drugs trade. By extrapolating the level of growth at the time of the study, a conservative estimate would have the level standing at $50 billion by 2025: equal to 10% of the total predicted value of the digital ad market. The latest Bad Bot Report from Imperva reveals a percentage of all last year internet traffic that was generated by bots \u2013 a mind-blowing 47.4%. Think about it \u2013 almost every second website visit comes not from a human being but a special software bot and if that wasn\u2019t enough \u2013 30% of those bots are bad ones, those that are meant to generate fake page views and so on. This scale of this increase can be attributed to the fact that digital ad fraud is relatively easy to perpetrate and delivers high returns, in combination with the relatively weak position which law enforcement agencies currently occupy when it comes to policing the internet. According to stats from Juniper Research, produced for a whitepaper published by ad fraud detection company TrafficGuard, it is estimated that, globally, one in 13 app installs in 2018 was not from genuine users (7.7%). The same source estimates that advertisers which display a million ads over a 24 hour-period will are likely to pay for more than 100,000 fraudulent ads before any issue is detected. According to a TrafficGuard whitepaper, fraudulent activity cost digital advertisers $39 million per day over the course of 2017. Calling on stats from Juniper Research, which break down the cost of ad fraud utilizing common tactics, App Install Farms/SDK Spoofing are responsible for the greatest share, at 42%. This is followed by Click Spam & Ad Stacking fraud (27.3%) and Click Injection (30.33%). The total cost of these ad fraud tactics comes to $25.8 billion according to this analysis. Proportional wasted ad spend owing to common fraud tactics in 2018 (%) Source: TrafficGuard These three common online ad fraud tactics are on the rise, reaching this year $20 billion for App Install Farms / SDK Spoofing, $35 billion for Click Spam & Ad Stacking and stunning $65 billion for Click Injection. Projected increase in cost from common ad fraud tactics ($billion) Source: TrafficGuard In 2019, eMarketer reported its estimates of the total cost varied from $6.5 billion to as high as $19 billion. It could well be worse; even the highest end of this scale seems to be on the conservative side by some measures. According to eMarketer, in 2022 programmatic display advertising, a whopping $15 billion business, covers 90% of all digital ads. This, of course, makes the threat of digital ad fraud ever more pressing \u2013 with complex and opaque supply chains between buyer and seller. Finally, putting together the estimates for digital ad fraud for the last several years and a year in a future, we see that up until 2021 there was, roughly speaking, $10 billion increase year-over-year and then it begins to double, adding about $20 billion this year and the estimate for 2023 is projected to be on the same track, reaching a $100 billion mark. Estimated cost of digital ad fraud worldwide from 2018 to 2023 ($billion) Source: Statista Ad fraud context Ad fraud by region The problem of digital ad fraud is particularly pronounced in the APAC region, in which the cost is estimated to be $17 million per day. Rapidly increasing penetration means that the question of mobile ad fraud is a particularly pertinent one in the region. The cost of ad fraud is predicted to increase in all regions over the next few years, with APAC will continue to be the hardest hit, with losses more than doubling from $33 billion to $75 billion. Estimated cost of ad fraud by region ($billion) Source: TrafficGuard In 2019 TrafficGuard, digital ad verification and fraud prevention platform joined forces with Jupiter Research again to build a comprehensive picture of percentage of digital ad fraud of total ad spend in different regions. The following graph demonstrates how much money were spent per digital user annually versus and how much of that figure was lost due to the ad fraud. And again \u2013 China, the biggest part of the APAC region, was leading the pack with $11 million of losses due to digital fraud for every $63 million spent on digital advertising per user per year, which was a whopping 17%. In the United States $62 million out of $407 million advertising spend per user was wasted due to digital ad fraud, which presented 15% of the total spend. Average ad spend versus fraud, by region ($million) Source: TrafficGuard & Jupiter Research On the opposite end of the spectrum was Africa and Middle East where annual digital ad fraud per user was \u201conly\u201d $1 million out of $19 million spent on digital advertising, a mere 5%. Ad fraud by app category and mobile OS Mobile Ad Fraud Detection and Prevention company Interceptd find in their 2019 Mobile Ad Fraud Report that Android suffers from a slightly higher level of digital ad fraud than iOS, with 31% of app traffic fraudulent, compared to 25%. Android ad fraud The same report also finds that some app categories are more vulnerable to fraud than other. On Android, finance tops the list, with over a third of installs fraudulent, followed by shopping, gaming, and social media. Ad fraud by app category: Android (%) Source: Interceptd Mobile ad fraud related to Android finance apps is dominated by bots/emulators, which are responsible for over a third of ad fraud in this category, and click injection, which accounts for a further quarter. SDK spoofing remains fairly low. Android finance app ad fraud types (%) Source: Interceptd SDK spoofing seems to be absent from the shopping category. Here, click spamming (22%) and device farms (21%) are the biggest problems. Interestingly \u2013 and worryingly for those looking to tackle the full gamut of problems \u2013 undefined \u2018other\u2019 forms are also responsible for 22% of ad fraud on Android shopping apps. Android shopping app ad fraud types (%) Source: Interceptd Gaming is the first category in which we see the hot button issue of SDK spoofing claim responsibility for the greatest share of ad fraud, at 24%. Device farming and incent abuse also register highly, at 19% apiece.

Some of these risks can be somewhat mitigated by reporting and single-level blocking, say TrafficGuard. Things like short-term wasted media spend and poor investments can be tackled to an extent through reporting, while single-level blocking can partially reduce the impact of the threat of litigation or diminishing campaign optimization. As we might expect, multi-level blocking is the only way to fully mitigate the full suite of risks associated with ad fraud, serving to block invalid traffic as it is detected. Much hope was placed in industry-led Ads.txt \u2013 a system which allows publishers to list companies authorised to sell their adverts via a simple txt files. Buyers are then able to check the list to see if the company from whom they are buying is legit. Ad fraud is, however, an ongoing game of cat and mouse between fraudsters and advertisers/ad fraud detection companies. And soon enough, schemes circumventing Ads.txt came to light, involving copied websites, botnets generating fake page views, and approved resellers. This scheme could have cost advertisers between $70-80 million had it continued to go undetected, reports the Wall Street Journal. Ads.txt had been adopted by 1.9 million websites by Q3, 2019, 48% up from the same quarter in the preceding year. Ads.txt adoption on the web (million websites) Source: Pixalate On the mobile side, looking at the Pixalate data from March to September 2019, we see a dramatic jump in the number of mobile apps that implemented mobile ads.txt equivalent in August of that year \u2013 from 23,000 to 68,000 within a month time frame. As of May 2022, it\u2019s been measured that 27% of Android apps and 7% of iOS apps have already adopted it as well.

An upgraded version of Ads.txt called Ads.cert, which will attempt to resolve the issues of Ads.txt by using cryptographically-stamped digital signatures to validate the source of impressions. As of this article writing in May 2022, IAB tech lab has been working on Ads.cert 2.0 to increase further level of authenticity in online advertising. The Ads.cert is the umbrella for several protocols that are meant to counteract rising levels of a fraud in digital advertising. Ad fraud advice Of course, there is whole industry of ad fraud detection companies, who can offer various services to help reduce the scourge of digital ad fraud. In a nutshell, the advice splits between technical solutions and better business practices which imply improved communication between advertisers and publishers. As well as working with ad fraud detection companies, there is a range of measures that can be taken by businesses. A compilation of such potential solutions proposed by agency experts to mitigate the high cost of ad fraud was published by Forbes. Working with DSPs who offer guarantees of fraud-free service can also be a good way to make sure that the cost of fraud that is detected is not incurred by clients, for example. Trying to minimize the number of companies worked with can help reduce risk also, particularly given the complexity of the supply chain and prevalence of programmatic ad fraud. On which note, companies are also advised to choose a programmatic tech stack which incorporates fraud solutions such as prebid filtering for IVT. Companies are advised to implement internal policies and processes in order to help cut the cost of fraud, as well as closely monitoring results and looking for obvious anomalies. Steps should be taken to increase transparency and data sharing in what can be a rather opaque field. In the face of what unfortunately looks to be an inescapable challenge for the ad industry, one other solution would be to change the pertinent metric, looking at performance rather than clicks. When it comes to SDK spoofing, Michael Paxman of MarTech Advisor warns that there is no such thing as a spoof-proof SDK. There are ways, however, in which one can lower the risk posed by this particular form of ad fraud: cryptographic SDK signatures. These can make the process of spoofing difficult and costly enough to hopefully disincentivize it. Entrepreneur.com also advises building language insertion orders, as these require that publishers identify all third-party sources of traffic. It also advises testing traffic sources, citing a programmatic ad fraud-test run by Guardian US in 2018. This test revealed that 72% of video spend was going to unauthorised exchanges and SSPs. In this case, use of ads.txt proved effective \u2013 with all ads.txt buying revenue going to Guardian US. Direct communication between publisher and advertiser, preferably between real, identifiable people, can also help to reduce risk \u2013 echoing the sentiment above about reducing the number of actors involved in any given transaction. In-app advertising and ad fraud rates Scott Silverman, the former vice president and general manager of Marketplace at InMobi, currently Global Revenue at Vungle, advises that in-app advertising is safer in terms of mobile ad fraud than running web advertisements. Reportedly, in-app advertising experienced 25% fewer fraud attempts than mobile web advertising over the second half of 2018. Online ad fraud involving bots and viruses designed to simulate human users occurred 74% less often in the same period. In-app advertising is by no means fraud proof, however. A report in Buzzfeed revealed that, after complaints that a popular app (unnamed to allow a source to speak anonymously) was draining users\u2019 batteries and using high amounts of data, it transpired that fraudsters were running video ads behind legitimate banner ads. These ads were not visible, but registered as being served and viewed. Several apps, including many using Twitter\u2019s MoPub platform, were affected by this scheme. An Israeli company with offices in New York called Aviview was implicated but denied any involvement claiming a third party exploited banner ads and codes created by one of its subsidiaries. This phenomenon has been reported in the past. One high-profile example reported in March 2018 used McDonald\u2019s ads as a cover up for a scheme, whereby fraudsters bought banner space posing as an agency, which was then resold as (much more expensive) video ads. The false McDonald\u2019s ads made it look like only banners were being served, while the covered-up videos playing in the background were being registered as served. Singapore and Bangalore-based Streamlyn were accused of being the fraudsters behind the scheme by a source speaking to Video Ad News. Several other companies were identified as being part of the chain that allowed the ads to be served in huge volumes (five million times in properties belonging to the source) \u2013 though simply being involved at some stage is no indication of guilt. AI and blockchain ad fraud protection While improving tech may increase the different ways in which digital ad fraud can be carried out, it also offers increasingly-advanced solutions to those aiming to prevent ad fraud. Machine learning could be key in ad fraud detection, says an ad fraud detection and protection company TrafficGuard, calling upon data from Juniper Research. This finds that, in all, machine learning will reduce the impact of ad fraud by about $10 billion by this year, increasing from $2 billion in 2018. In APAC, this will stand at $3.5 billion \u2013 up from $0.6 billion in 2018. Ad fraud money saved through machine learning solutions ($billions) Source: TrafficGuard Big names like Facebook and Google are already calling on neural networks and machine learning to help in ad fraud detection and prevention. For companies which can\u2019t fall back on their own proprietary AI research, third-party AI solutions are provided by various ad fraud detection companies. By the end of 2022, global advertising spending enabled and powered by the use of machine learning will reach $370 billion and by 2032 this figure will reach $1.3 trillion. AI can detect suspicious behavior, filter IP addresses, and generally monitor traffic. Its increasing prevalence in combating ad fraud will come in tandem with general wider use in advertising \u2013 to target specific markets for example. Blockchain has also been suggested as a potential solution to ad fraud, affording the complete transparency which has been so deeply compromised by programmatic ad fraud. Various blockchain solutions to online ad fraud are proposed: One is to give users tokens when they opt-in to view ads on a platform which blocks third-party and programmatic ads. These can then be awarded to websites and publishers by users. Several prestigious media groups have expressed interest in this platform. Other services simply offer transparent, validated data to allow marketers to accurately measure value delivered \u2013 predicated on the requirement to establish and enforce rigorous standards across the board. Or the use of public key cryptology to confirm identities of publishers, advertisers, and advertisers. Brands and ad fraud: fears and responses Research from eMarketer shows that brands are more wary of online ad fraud, when it comes to in-app advertising at least. 52% of brands said that fear of fraud was a concern, making it their leading worry. Agencies as a whole are significantly more sanguine, with 36% reporting this as a concern, putting it joint-last. The case remains the same when it comes to video advertising, with 57% of brands registering it as a challenge. On video, it seems agencies are in closer alignment with brands, with 42% reporting that fear of fraud was a challenge. This takes it to number two in the list of concerns. Challenges related to in-app advertising: brands vs. agencies (%) AdvertisingVideo BrandsAgenciesBrandsAgencies Fear of fraud52365742 Viewability measurement challenges42284444 Brand safety concerns38463736 Attribution concerns36262426 Concerns about effective targeting25383238 Source: eMarketer A study conducted by Integral Ad Science and referenced by eMarketer asked agencies and brand professionals what they considered to be strong threats to digital ad budgets in 2019. In this instance, agency professionals seemed to be more concerned about the impact of fraudulent impressions, with 69% reporting it as a concern, versus 53% of brand professionals (which we should note is still more than half). Agency professionals collectively did not feel anything threatened ad budgets to the same extent; seemingly in-house marketers are more worried by other threats. The survey results were published in late January 2019. eMarketer believe that brands will become more alive to the threat posed by fraud. Threats to digital ad budgets, brands vs. agencies (%) Source: eMarketer Brands\u2019 reactions to the increasing threat of fraud varies. A study by Forrester found 69% of brands spending $1 million per month reported that at least 20% of their budgets were being lost to digital ad fraud. In the face of this, however, 70% of these companies reported that they were actually planning to increase their advertising budget. This is not universally the case by any means, however. In January 2018, Procter & Gamble announced it was planning to save $750 million by cutting its ad budget, and reducing the number of agencies with which it worked by 50% (from 2,500 to 1,250). This was to be followed by a further $400 million cut in the next phase. A year previously, P&G chief marketing officer Marc Pritchard had warned the media buying and selling industry that it needed to clean up its act, demanding a \u201ctransparent, clean and productive media supply chain\u201d. In 2017, JPMorgan Chase cut the number of sites on which it advertised from 400,000 to 5,000 (though this doubled to 10,000 by the end of the year). According to The New York Times, JPMorgan Chase claimed that the cull had no immediate effect on results. Ad fraud expert Dr Augustine Fou advises other companies to consider following in the footsteps of P&G, cutting their budgets (albeit more gradually) and seeing what the real effect on the bottom line is. As of 2021, according to the leading mobile app analytics company AppsFlyer, app install fraud rates in leading verticals are the following: Food & Drink \u2013 43%, Finance \u2013 38%, Shopping \u2013 17%, Entertainment \u2013 15% and Gaming \u2013 2%. In 2019 Uber stopped running app install ad campaigns that cost the company $120 million, they saw no significant difference in the rate of generation of new app installs. Final thoughts It\u2019s clear that the scale of digital ad fraud is far larger than many in the advertising world would or should ever be comfortable with. Will the problem continue to get worse or will see, as some have speculated (and we all hope), an improvement? Dr Augustine Fou, quoted above, believes that the only way that the issue of ad fraud will be resolved will be for the whole industry to collapse and begin again. This outcome is not only likely, he argues, but desirable \u2013 resulting in a new, more effective, less profligate approach to digital marketing. This is naturally on the more dramatic side of things; those who remember the bursting of the dot com bubble, or even the financial crash of 2008, however, will presumably better know better than to rule it out. Certainly, a largescale loss of trust in the industry seems eminently plausible. We haven\u2019t yet seen a mass following of the example set by Procter & Gamble or JPMorgan Chase, but as buyers become savvier to the dangers of ad fraud, we could well see a tightening of focus, with advertisers and publishers alike seeking to foster more personal relationships. Perhaps this would ostensibly reduce the size of the market \u2013 but if large swathes of the available market consists of invalid traffic, then it is artificially bloated anyway. This of course would have a fascinating effect \u2013 with actors from all points in the supply chain potentially affected. Those in the middle in particular look set to suffer if this became the case; this could have a potentially devastating effect on the ad-tech industry as a whole. While there\u2019s not yet evidence that this is the case, those occupying this space would well to prepare. Looking at ways to address fraud, and to refocus efforts to achieve conversions over views would be apt preparation for a best-case outcome; having a pretty substantial Plan B would be apt preparation for the worst. Notwithstanding any large-scale or wholescale changes in the way business is conducted, we might also look with some optimism to the future. Awareness has risen, which is the first step in addressing digital ad fraud. We are seeing improvements in artificial intelligence and the prospect of blockchain promises nothing short of a revolution in transparency. While it may be an ongoing arms race, ad fraud detection companies are making a concerted effort to stay ahead. Whether it will be able to in perpetuity remains to be seen. Some are sceptical. But faced with the level of challenge with which we are, we must put our lot and our faith in these organisations to make an impact. Particularly with the global increase in mobile penetration, most concentrated in the Asia Pacific region. The future, then, is uncertain \u2013 bar two things. One, the persistence of criminal elements attempting to abuse a system that is seemingly easily abused, to the tune of billions of dollars. Two, our collective need to address and tackle this ongoing issue.",

      "content": "With global losses due to ad fraud projected at $100 billion by the end of the year, Ann Tarasewicz, CEO, Axis, takes a look at strategies that ad tech platforms are implementing to enhance ad fraud security in 2024. According to Juniper Research, the global losses companies will face due to ad fraud will be about $100 billion by the end of 2024. And, as the digital world is changing rapidly, fraudsters are becoming more advanced and organized. They are already actively using artificial intelligence to create bots, and that\u2019s not the limit. The cybercriminal community is applying the latest technologies to test new and more effective ways to siphon money from advertisers\u2019 budgets. The reason for this is simple. Advertisers place ads to build up their audience or customer base, and they are increasingly using mobile devices to access the Internet. This is what leads to the growing number of cybercrimes. Fraudsters are also following technological developments and adapting the latest solutions for their own selfish and criminal purposes. Digital advertising fraudsters are rapidly increasing in number and are organizing themselves into criminal gangs to strengthen their attacks and implement new ideas. But it\u2019s not like ad tech is sitting idly by on this one. Let\u2019s look deeper at the strategies that ad tech platforms are implementing to enhance ad fraud security in 2024. Fraud Detection Algorithms Ad exchanges and programmatic middleware solutions use strict verification procedures to ensure the authenticity of traffic sources and eliminate fraudulent impressions. This involves monitoring various metrics, including user engagement, traffic origin, and historical data, to distinguish genuine human traffic from bot-generated activity. While it may seem complex, the crux lies in balancing security and profit preservation. A multi-tiered approach to traffic verification is indispensable in today\u2019s landscape. Indeed, implementing a sophisticated verification system demands resource investment, yet ultimately yields benefits in the form of consistent profits and advertiser trust. Advanced Analytics and AI Today\u2019s fraud detection tools leverage machine learning, data analysis, and pattern recognition techniques to assess the validity of ad impressions, clicks, and conversions, enabling advertisers and publishers to detect and block fraudulent traffic in real time. These technologies enable the analysis of vast amounts of data to identify anomalous patterns and behaviors indicative of fraudulent activity. Machine learning algorithms can glean insights from past data and adjust to evolving fraud schemes, thereby improving the precision and effectiveness of fraud detection systems. Real-time monitoring and automated decision-making empower advertisers, publishers, and ad networks to promptly address potential threats and mitigate ad fraud before it adversely affects campaign performance. Ad Verification Partnerships Teaming up with specialized ad verification companies can enhance fraud prevention efforts. Collaborating with these organizations provides access to advanced tools and specialized expertise tailored for detecting and preventing ad fraud. By integrating their solutions into the platform, ad exchanges can provide advertisers with heightened transparency and confidence in the legitimacy of their ad campaigns. Moreover, these partnerships enable continuous monitoring of ad inventory, ensuring alignment with industry standards and best practices. Prioritizing such collaborations not only fosters trust with advertisers but also reinforces the integrity of the advertising ecosystem. Industry Initiatives Embrace collaborative strategies in the fight against ad fraud by forming partnerships with industry initiatives such as the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG). Many ad exchanges have joined forces with TAG to establish standardized guidelines and protocols for fraud prevention. TAG certification programs enable ad exchanges to showcase their commitment to ensuring transparency across all platform processes, a crucial aspect in the fight against advertising fraud. Initiatives like TAG enable the creation of a safer environment that benefits all participants in the advertising bidding process, ensuring satisfaction and preventing any grievances. The digital advertising sector grapples with an ongoing challenge posed by ad fraud. Consequently, ad exchanges are implementing stronger measures to mitigate this threat. They are amplifying their endeavors to implement advanced and resilient prevention strategies, aiming to counteract this problem and uphold a reliable ecosystem beneficial for both advertisers and publishers.

      "content": "Thursday, August 29th, 2024 \u2013 7:00 am SHARE: Determining whether publishers are shady enough to be cut from the programmatic supply chain means grappling with shades of gray. But when a publisher is engaged in obviously illegal activity like piracy \u2013 and going to great lengths to hide it from programmatic advertisers \u2013 then the decision becomes black and white. Ad fraud detection and verification firm HUMAN recently encountered one of those black and white cases when it investigated a Brazil-based programmatic cashout mechanism for pirated content, which HUMAN dubbed \u201cCamu.\u201d As part of the Camu scam, publishers trafficking in pirated movies, TV shows and games sold programmatic ads alongside this stolen content while using domain cloaking to obscure the \u201ccashout sites\u201d where the ads actually ran. HUMAN\u2019s investigation, led by its Satori threat intelligence team, illustrates how disreputable publishers are able to monetize stolen content through programmatic advertising\u2019s convoluted supply chains while avoiding common methods for detecting ad fraud. As it turns out, outright scammers are taking cues for how to cover their tracks from made for advertising (MFA) sites. A domain by any other name The Camu operation, which the Satori team discovered in December and revealed in a report published today, was the largest cloaking operation HUMAN has exposed thus far. At its peak, it was associated with 2.5 billion bid requests per day, mostly originating in Brazil, that were spread across more than 130 domains built to facilitate this deception. The domains that host pirated content are only accessible when navigated to via piracy hub sites, said William Herbig, director of fraud detection and data operations at HUMAN. Some MFA publishers do something similar, which is to only display their heavy ad loads when being accessed by paid traffic. However, these ad-heavy pages can also be accessed by manually entering the URL. In the case of Camu, if an advertiser attempts to do due diligence by navigating to the URLs listed in post-campaign reports, what would load is simply an unremarkable page rather than a page hosting stolen content. Subscribe AdExchanger Daily Get our editors\u2019 roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Daily Roundup Daily News Roundup Cadent Gets Direct; Curating YouTube, Netflix-Style Say, for example, a user visits filmize.tv, a site included in HUMAN\u2019s investigation, to watch the new movie \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d When the user clicks the \u201cWatch Online Now\u201d button, the site drops a cookie that allows a URL to load where that user can illegally stream the movie. This page also features several programmatically placed ads. However, if an advertiser tried to visit the same URL, the browser would load an inconspicuous placeholder site instead. Because the advertiser didn\u2019t click through from a piracy hub, the browser wouldn\u2019t have the cookie needed to load the page where the stolen content lives. HUMAN\u2019s report on the Camu scam includes a screenshot of a page from the domain \u201cguiacripto.online\u201d that hosts a media player for streaming pirated content. This screenshot also shows ads from Vrbo and car rental company Sixt. However, navigating to the URL manually or clicking a link from a search results page loads an innocuous blog about cryptocurrencies. This kind of domain cloaking is a classic marker of sophisticated invalid traffic, according to the Media Rating Council. \u201cWe can very firmly call this IVT,\u201d Herbig said. \u201cThere\u2019s multiple pieces of misrepresentation going on.\u201d In addition to cloaking domains and creating different site experiences depending on a user\u2019s route, he said, these publishers are obfuscating the source of referral traffic to make it seem like users arrived at these pages from reputable links or search engines, rather than hub sites entirely devoted to piracy. Detecting the scam Making matters worse, scams like Camu are also undetectable using typical means for catching programmatic ad fraud, Herbig said. \u201cYou have real users on real devices who are being served viewable impressions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tricky part is [determining] where the ads are actually being loaded, and that\u2019s not something you can easily do, at least by looking at standard metrics.\u201d And although scams like Camu have a lot in common with MFAs, they can\u2019t be fought using the same strategies, Herbig said. For example, MFA sites create a separate experience for paid traffic, which makes focusing on paid traffic sources a viable method for detecting MFA activity. But piracy sites have no such emphasis on paid traffic. However, the fact that piracy sites host stolen content makes it easier to single them out for scrutiny. Indeed, HUMAN was able to uncover the Camu operation because its Satori team was proactively looking to expose programmatic supply chains associated with monetizing piracy sites, Herbig said. No advertiser wants to monetize stolen content. The Satori team analyzed HUMAN\u2019s entire data set of more than 20 trillion bid requests per week across three billion unique devices, looking for red flags that could be associated with piracy. It also monitored a range of IP addresses that were associated with known piracy sites in the past to examine what other sites these addresses were visiting and whether anything seems off about them. \u201cWe immediately noticed this pattern between the cashout sites where our customers\u2019 traffic was loading and one of these [known] piracy domains,\u201d Herbig said. \u201cFrom there, we started tagging different IVT behaviors.\u201d For instance, HUMAN examined every domain that was also using the known domain\u2019s specific cookie settings and hunted for other domains engaged in the same specific type of referral overwriting. HUMAN also tracked programmatic supply chains that have monetized known piracy domains to find similar domains. The Camu scam relied on a high degree of reselling by programmatic intermediaries to remain hidden, Herbig said. In many cases, new domains that were created after old domains were demonetized relied on the same sequence of resellers. Based on these findings, HUMAN was able to introduce seven different pre- and post-bid mitigations over the past nine months aimed at stopping ads from serving on piracy domains. Although the Camu scam is still active, HUMAN was able to cut advertising activity associated with these domains from 2.5 billion daily bid requests to 100 million daily bid requests. Herbig declined to elaborate on HUMAN\u2019s mitigations, as doing so could give bad actors a playbook for how to avoid them. Made for IVT Going forward, HUMAN believes the best way to crack down on scams like Camu is for the industry to reach an explicit consensus that all traffic to piracy sites should be considered IVT, Herbig said. But unfortunately, going after piracy sites won\u2019t help address the industry\u2019s other big advertising scam \u2013 MFA sites. AdExchanger asked HUMAN to compare Camu to the Forbes MFA subdomain scandal, which blindsided the industry. While the Camu scam and the Forbes situation both relied on having different site experiences depending on the traffic source, \u201cthere is no relationship between the Camu operation and previous domain mismatch issues,\u201d a HUMAN spokesperson said. The Forbes case involved misdeclaring its \u201cwww3\u201d MFA subdomain in bid requests, whereas Camu had \u201cno instances of basic root or subdomain domain mismatch,\u201d the spokesperson said. In Camu\u2019s case, \u201cthe misrepresentation comes from two completely different sites loading from the same URL based on how the user arrives,\u201d rather than having two different URLs for different traffic sources, they added. Either way, piracy sites engaging in obviously illegal activity are an easier target for demonetization than MFA sites, which might be gaming programmatic systems, but aren\u2019t necessarily doing anything illegal. \u201cDomains like this are made for IVT, not made for advertising,\u201d Herbig said. \u201cThey are going multiple steps beyond what is in any way acceptable in our industry.\u201d Tagged in: Camu // domain cloaking // featured // forbes // Forbes www3 // Human // ivt // MFA // MRC // piracy sites // Satori // SIVT // Sixt // Vrbo // William Herbig",

There are several common trends that were mentioned frequently: Applying a holistic approach of combating ad fraud across multiple channels will become more prominent Making ad fraud financially unsustainable via developing and applying more sophisticated click validation standards will help to prevent ad fraud InApp ad fraud will continue to be a key challenge Online Advertising Fraud Prevention Thought LeadersInterceptd Soner Sensoy Co-Founder \u201cFraudsters will combine their highly specialized skills in 2020, attacking the whole marketing funnel and further evading detection. Over the course of our fraud detection journey, we have come across different types of fraud behavior in different markets and channels. From non-viewable ads to nonexistent installs, from ads shown in unwanted publishers to organic hijacking. We even detected fraudsters who are able to manipulate store (Google Play and App Store) numbers with unidentified techniques. It seems that each fraudster is sophisticated in a unique type of mechanism. For example, some are focusing on branding campaigns, by inflating the numbers of highly viewable ads. Some are focusing on hijacking organic installs of performance marketers. We expect fraudsters to combine their technological capabilities in order to manipulate the whole marketing funnel of advertisers from impression to in-app engagement. Eventually, we predict ad fraud to increase in evasiveness. Thus, ad fraud prevention in 2020 will require a holistic approach by combining different metrics including viewability, IVT detection, install verification and also in-app bot detection. Utilizing your company resources effectively by outsourcing ad fraud prevention to the experts. Brand marketers and UA managers already have highly involved roles. It makes little sense to expect them to tackle ad fraud in addition to their daily duties. Companies, especially those focusing on digital advertising need to outsource to individuals whose daily role revolves around scrutinizing marketing data from an ad fraud perspective. Those professionals will use ad fraud prevention tools and work closely with marketing teams. They will further optimize and filter marketing channels and help marketing teams to build a combined marketing stack to automate all efforts effectively.\u201d Adjust Paul H. M\u00fcller CTO Adjust \u201cWhile detection can\u2019t be used as a standalone solution to ad fraud, it is a great way to identify and research new types of fraud. We cannot fight what we can\u2019t see \u2013 so it stands to reason that fraud prevention always has to begin with fraud detection. Fraudsters are extremely skilled, and are constantly developing new ways to spoof advertisers. The only sure way to deter fraudsters is to make it financially unsustainable for them. In 2020, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our fraud prevention technology, focusing on the data points that are hardest to fake. In 2020, we\u2019ll see more focus on impression and click, and how the link between the two is essential to fighting fraud. A user can only click on an ad if they have actually been served and seen it. That sounds like common sense, but all too often, these clicks aren\u2019t made by real users. That\u2019s why Adjust created the Click Validation standard earlier this year, which requires ad channels send impressions with a unique identifier that will also be attached to any resulting clicks before the click claim is sent. This dramatically increases the workload for fraudsters, to the point where it becomes financially unviable for them. Though there are always new exploits being developed by fraudsters, that doesn\u2019t mean the underlying systems vary. Knowing the limitations of these systems, and that new methods of ad fraud can only develop within these parameters, makes it easier to apply solutions. At the moment, Click Injection and Click Spam are two of the most pervasive methods of ad fraud, currently accounting for 43% and 30% of all ad fraud respectively. It\u2019s likely we\u2019ll continue to see them being used against unprotected apps in 2020. That makes measures like the Click Validation requirement all the more important, because it dramatically increases the workload for fraudsters seeking to steal brands\u2019 and advertisers\u2019 ad budgets.\u201d TrafficGuard Luke Taylor COO \u201cMore fraudulent traffic is originating from individual devices, generated by malware. This means fraud prevention needs to be able to differentiate between human and bot traffic on the same advice. This type of traffic easily circumvents blacklists and is only sometimes picked up by rules and thresholds. Distinguishing genuine ad engagements from fraud is going to rely on building intelligence around the reputations and profiles of devices, IPs, apps, traffic sources and domains and understanding the interconnected nature of these objects. The effectiveness of this effort comes down to building this intelligence over time and having the capability to leverage it for real-time validation. Moving into 2020, this type of granular, machine learning driven fraud detection will be essential. More mobile app advertisers need to verify attribution. For app campaigns, fraudsters take aim at the MMP\u2019s attribution function because ultimately, tricking the MMP leads to the fraudster getting paid. Independent fraud prevention plays a critical role in verifying attribution and stopping ad fraud. A lot of credence is paid to the fraudsters\u2019 ability to develop new types of fraud, but in reality they are able to make a lot of money with very rudimentary techniques and slight adaptations. For example, we are seeing much more click spam generated by malware on devices rather than servers. The principle is the same \u2013 high volumes of clicks are sent to the campaign in the hope that the MMP will misattribute an install/conversion to the source of the fraudulent click. However, the execution has changed to help it circumvent their fraud detection mechanisms. Likewise, the rising popularity of re-engagement campaigns aiming to bring dormant users back to apps, is another avenue to give click spam another bite of ad budgets. Fraudsters don\u2019t need to be massively innovative to make a buck. In 2020, I expect we will see more of the same \u2013 new evolutions of old tactics as well as old tactics employed across new channels (CTV/OTT) and emerging campaign types.\u201d Protected Media Asaf Greiner Founder & CEO \u201cAs hackers are learning to manipulate AI/Machine learning detection methods and \u201cfly under the radar\u201d techniques focused on the detection of attack platforms will demonstrate resilience to fuzzy changes and will create effective detection. CTV is the rising target for attackers. it blends high rates with low abilities to measure and verify from the advertiser side. 2020 needs to focus on creating effective means to create a trusted CTV world. CTV impersonation along with CTV manipulations will evolve. InApp ad fraud will stay a key challenge and new techniques would take advantage of the advertiser\u2019s budgets.\u201d Scalarr Inna Ushakova Co-founder & CEO \u201cIn 2020, fraud will change dynamically and to maintain a high level of protection against it, anti-fraud products should use the integrated approach of ML-technologies. Unfortunately, highlighting any specific fraud detection technique or rules will not be able to protect you against fraud. Indeed, the key will be the ability to process and analyze large volumes of data at a very deep level. Without a high level of computation, this is not possible. For mobile app install ad fraud in 2020, we will see a lot of evidence of the fact that existing mobile ad fraud prevention techniques work extremely inaccurately (especially if we\u2019re talking about MMPs anti-fraud tools). Namely, they give out a lot of false positive and false negative decisions, which creates the illusion of \u201cprotection\u201d for the advertiser, but it actually distorts UA (user acquisition) metrics severely. The existing concept and technology of mobile app install fraud prevention mistakenly blocks hundreds of thousands of non-fraud installs and, conversely, does not block millions of fraud installs. This creates a huge imbalance in the industry and moves it in critically off target. According to Scalarr experts, active modification of existing fraud types will continue: click injection, complex VTA spoofing, click spam, smart bots. In 2020, fraudsters will also try to do effective reverse engineering of anti-fraud tools in order to go unnoticed for as long as possible. Also, Mobile ad fraud will become more integrated \u2013 that is, fraudsters will \u201cfake\u201d a complex set of different metrics (impressions, clicks, installs, post-install events, purchases, etc.), rather than emulate them at different individual levels \u2013 display, click, install, etc. It is important to note that fraudsters are actively targeting shopping apps (eCommerce) and non-gaming categories, which will entail a general increase in emulations, since a fairly large number of players in this market purchase traffic using the CPA (cost per action) model.\u201d NS8 Gabriel Shepherd Executive VP of Marketing \u201cThroughout 2020, detection techniques will continue to improve upon technology that is already available. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen algorithms and AI get better at detecting anomalies in behavior, static data, and even individual devices. These will only get stronger with more data informing them. Additionally, blockchain solutions will likely start to crop up. The biggest challenge for these will be adoption, making them less effective than other solutions. We may also see innovations in analytics as data privacy continues to be a significant issue. Working with untethered or randomized data may be more important moving forward. The biggest challenge for ad fraud prevention in 2020 will be incorporating solutions to protect the entire digital advertising process. Ads.txt, user scoring, and bot detection/blocking each cover a portion of the process. However, none of these methods protect against all forms of ad fraud. While blockchain can currently provide information on the whole process (if adopted by companies at every stage), it still has no enforcement mechanism to actually prevent fraud. That means fraud prevention companies need to work on integrations and more well-rounded solutions in the coming year. As new types of digital advertising and targeted marketing come into existence, so will new kinds of ad fraud. We\u2019ll likely see a rise in fraud for audio formats as programmatic audio advertising begins to be used more often in digital radio, podcasts, and music-streaming services. We may also see a rise in sophisticated bots as more people opt out of sharing data and fraud attempts to fill that space with high-value targets. New forms of affiliate fraud will probably continue to appear as companies focus on diversifying and creating omnichannel sales.\u201d",

      "content": "SHAPING WHAT\u2019S NEXT IN MEDIA Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 SECURE YOUR SEAT The Programmatic Publisher The FT warns advertisers after discovering high levels of domain spoofing By Jessica Davies \u2022 September 27, 2017 \u2022 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit The Financial Times has investigated the scale of domain spoofing occurring against its site, and has been shocked by the results. The publisher has found display ads against inventory masquerading as FT.com on 10 separate ad exchanges and video ads on 15 exchanges, even though the FT doesn\u2019t even sell video ads programmatically, with 300 accounts selling inventory purporting to be the FT\u2019s. The scale of the fraud uncovered is vast \u2014 the equivalent of one month\u2019s supply of bona fide FT.com video inventory was fraudulently appearing in a single day. The FT has estimated the value of the fraudulent inventory to be \u00a31 million ($1.3 million) a month. \u201cThe scale of the fraud we found is jaw-dropping,\u201d said Anthony Hitchings, the FT\u2019s digital advertising operations director. \u201cThe industry continues to waste marketing budgets on what is essentially organized crime.\u201d Jon Slade, Financial Times chief commercial officer, on Sept. 27 planned to notify the exchanges in question by mail to remove the fraudulent inventory, with the promise that the FT will check back in a month to ensure action has been taken. Hitchings wouldn\u2019t say which exchanges were at fault but added that they are \u201cknown\u201d names. A second letter is on its way to 11,000 of the FT\u2019s client and agency contacts, explaining the problem and asking them to watch out for inventory that isn\u2019t sourced from the two exchanges the FT sells its display inventory through, Google AdX and TrustX. The fraud investigation coincided with the FT\u2019s adoption of ads.txt, the Interactive Advertising Bureau Tech Lab\u2019s tool created to help publishers combat ad fraud \u2014 specifically domain spoofing, but also arbitrage via unauthorized reselling. Other publishers including the Guardian and News UK have also adopted ads.txt, though uptake has been slow in the U.K. In his letter, Slade urged the buy side to push for publisher adoption of ads.txt. \u201cWe are working with partners to support the adoption of ads.txt by all publishers, as part of our ongoing efforts to help clean up digital advertising. By eliminating this extremely widespread form of fraud, budgets will work that much harder for advertisers and the revenue will reach working media to fund the independent, high-quality journalism which society, especially today, depends upon,\u201d Slade wrote in the letter to client and agency contacts. Domain spoofing has long dogged digital advertising, and premium publishers are top targets for fraudsters, as advertisers will pay a lot for their inventory. The scale at which publishers have become domain-spoofing targets was brought under a sharp spotlight in February after the \u201cMethbot\u201d scheme, which spoofed more than 6,000 publishers in the U.S. \u201cThis is what inspires fraudsters to take a vanilla URL and dress it up as a comScore top 50 site, so it appears more attractive to DSPs. This results in the fraudsters getting paid, the advertiser having to deal with some terrible PR about their brand appearing on a random site and the publisher is left out of pocket. Ads.txt is going to help stamp a lot of these bad actors out,\u201d said ad tech consultant Paul Gubbins. The Financial Times has long favored direct deals with advertisers, so programmatic ads only account for 5 percent of its advertising revenue. That could mean other publishers who rely more on programmatic revenue could have an even bigger domain-spoofing problem. It\u2019s not the first time the FT has looked into fraud on its own site, although it is the first time it has conducted this particular test. Previously, a bank came to the FT to talk about poor performance of its ads, which the bank had bought via a trading desk, according to Hitchings. \u201cThe brand thought they had bought a homepage takeover for the day and were expecting high impact. Not a single ad appeared,\u201d he said. We\u2019ll discuss the next phase of programmatic at the Digiday Publishing Summit Europe. Learn more here.

      "content": "SHAPING WHAT\u2019S NEXT IN MEDIA Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 SECURE YOUR SEAT Generative AI How the growth of click and impression farming are getting worse with AI By Antoinette Siu \u2022 August 29, 2023 \u2022 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit While click farming and impression farming have been around for a while in digital advertising, the increased use of artificial intelligence may worsen these larger fraud-related problems. It\u2019s the last thing agencies and brands need, given how much fraud they\u2019re already chasing down. Whether it is farming for clicks or for impressions, which can be different based on the platform targeted, agencies say AI will likely play a big role in helping these bots and bad inventory to scale massively. \u201cClick farming and click fraud is getting paid to click on anything,\u201d said Tyler Nall, group vp of platform strategy at Publicis Health Media. \u201cImpression fraud is the same type of thing but for impressions, so it\u2019s getting paid to generate it \u2026 We need to make changes structurally in how we think about programmatic and how we transact programmatically if we\u2019re going to address this issue.\u201d With ever more digital content and inventory in the ad business, the risk of fraud from ads being traded programmatically keeps rising at a commensurate level. While fraud detection and supply chain and ad tech solutions are still being developed, ad dollars often go to waste as ads get served to bots instead of consumers. \u201cImpression farming has long plagued programmatic advertising, including on platforms like Google Ads and Facebook Ads,\u201d added Humphrey Ho, managing partner for Americas at Hylink Group. Escalating ad fraud in the industry While agencies and influencers alike have been experimenting with generative AI for content creation and ideation, experts have raised questions over the impact on ad spend and production waste. They say AI-produced content equals bad inventory, including fake or bad impressions, misinformation and plagiarism. \u201cThese advancements exacerbate the challenges posed by click farming, surpassing its previous daily limitations,\u201d Ho said. But the greater concern of ad fraud has been around as programmatic advertising automated the buying and selling process of online ads \u2013 which is convenient, but risks more scams in the system. In 2019, Statista estimated some 20% of ad impressions served programmatically in the U.S. were fraudulent. As more of advertising gets digitized, fraud has only worsened: Between 2018 and 2023, the digital ad fraud is projected to grow from $35 billion to $100 billion, per Statista. By ANA\u2019s estimate in June\u2019s programmatic and supply chain study, the $88 billion open programmatic media ecosystem results in some $20 billion in wasted spending \u2013 accounting for 23% of the total investments. The association cited lack of data access and transparency, prioritizing cost over value and other inefficiencies throughout the process. The ANA also noted that Made for Advertising (MFA) websites in the study represented 21% of impressions, in which advertisers are not in control of media placement decisions. These sites feature low-quality content, from fake news and spam to pop-up ads and auto-play videos in order to maximize ad revenue. How AI exacerbates the problem Think of AI having the superpower to amplify audience fraud in programmatic. What may have been human-staffed click or impression farms can now get boosted by smart bots to falsify impressions and attract ad dollars. AI can not only create the bad inventory \u2013 but fake the traffic going to these sites and create fake accounts on ad exchanges, Publicis Health Media\u2019s Nall explained. \u201cIf you were so minded, you can very easily create AI to create hundreds of thousands of websites with otherwise bogus ad impressions on them, that might very much look like real valid traffic,\u201d Nall added. \u201cBecause programmatic happens at such scale, it\u2019s very hard to catch these things. Nall contended that marketers need to reframe the way they evaluate campaigns and viewability of inventory \u2013 and not overly focus on CPMs as a measure of return on investment. \u201cWe have to take a hard look at that financial transaction, and instead of using programmatic CPM basis, which just incentivizes the creation of more impressions, you need to be looking at other types of metrics, transacting on cost per engagement, transacting on valid traffic,\u201d Nall told Digiday. Hylink Group\u2019s Ho agreed that AI escalates the issue, as bad content and SEO manipulation continue to attract ad placements. Moreover, these spam sites and ad farms are getting better at emulating \u201clegitimate commerce or industry-oriented platforms that aggregate content. This transformation raises concerns about brand safety due to the potentially problematic nature of content aggregation,\u201d Ho said. Vitaly Boitelet, chief product officer at Stagwell Marketing Cloud\u2019s SmartAssets, acknowledged the challenges posed as more businesses build bots, crawlers and scrapers to gather more data points. The more data they have, the more they can feed their machine-learning algorithms to generate AI insights. Call it an-unvirtuous cycle. \u201cThese bots are distorting the data, weakening the quality of the insights these machine learning models were intended to provide,\u201d Boitelet added. It isn\u2019t just the marketing side that plays a role, but the demand side as well. Yet it is a bit awkward for the ad platforms to push to solve the problem \u2013 because it ultimately contributes to their revenue, Boitelet explained. It will also be up to other sectors, including financial and identity fraud services, to address and fight back against the bots. \u201cAd platforms\u2019 responses have been understandably cautious,\u201d Boitelet said. \u201cThe silver lining, though, lies in the fact that the increase in AI-generated insights is increasing the value for a solution.\u201d Share Copy \u00d7 Share this article Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Trending in Generative AI 01 WTF Series WTF is liquid content? 02 Super Bowl Facing \u2018AI slop\u2019 and a trust problem, AI platforms invest in Super Bowl-level brand ads Sponsored AI isn\u2019t just changing search \u2014 it\u2019s rewriting the ad stack 03 Bold Call Bold Call: AI will rewrite publishers\u2019 websites in 2026 Most Read 01 Marketing on Platforms TikTok\u2019s confirmed U.S. deal still leaves unanswered questions 02 The Creator Economy TikTok moderation has pushed some news creators to the limit 03 Business of TV Programmatic advertising on TV is set to increase this year 04 WTF Series WTF is liquid content? 05 Content & Commerce \u2018Things have changed\u2019: Diageo pulls retail media upstream More in Media Buying View More Navigating Economic Instability \u2018There seems to be a mind shift\u2019: Advertisers keep ad spending flexible as uncertainty persists January 29, 2026 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Nobody expected serenity to be clear.

      "content": "2026 Predictions for Mobile Games By Mariam Ahmad 3 December 2025 Stores are opening up, regulation is stepping in, and retention is finally getting the respect UA once owned - 2026 is shaping up to be an interesting year for the mobile gaming world. We asked over 20 industry experts where the year is headed - here\u2019s where the consensus, tension, and opportunity sit. USER ACQUISITION Marketing will eat the market The name of the game in 2026 will be doubling down on marketing. Marketing is currently more important than product itself in the mobile game industry, as getting volume of users requires either an enormously strong IP or the UA product funnel of Fake ads and Fake onboarding, which is driven mainly by the Chinese mobile juggernauts slowly conquering the market. AI is actually already accelerating this, as currently the biggest impact of AI on the mobile game industry is ad creatives. We see the ratio between AI and non AI creatives in company portfolios constantly growing in favour of AI and we think that by the end of 2026, more than 50% of creatives will be either having an AI hook at the start or will be completely generated by AI. The other biggest growth vector again supercharging this trend will be AI playables, or more precisely the explosion of speed of their creation, which again we already see happening in China. This means that by the end of 2026, mobile game studios will either adjust to these trends or they can continue making pretty much perfect mobile games, which won't be having any users as they will get stomped over by the ones executing this marketing strategy. Choose wisely \ud83d\ude0a. Jakub Remiar, Mobile F2P Games Consultant & Co-founder + Host of two and a half gamers Welcome back, ad tech - may the next great platform please stand up? Ad monetization and UA tech are \u201cso back\u201d in 2026. So much is bubbling in ad tech world. Aurion11 (the ex Outfit7 team), Playgap (ex Unity team) and iion (brand ads) are all building exciting things for 2026. But nothing trumped the huge move by the team that brought you MoPub and Max Ads: CloudX. Jim Payne & Dan Sack are back and finding ways of giving control back to publishers and add additional transparency to the bidding process using a healthy dose of AI. Will they go all the way this time and challenge Applovin properly\u2026 or will Applovin take them out again (as happened with Max Ads and MoPub). Pass me the chilli-flavored popcorn please. Mobile games\u2019 sentiment will improve. Apps have been in the spotlight massively in 2025. In comparison to mobile games they are super fast to ship, thanks to gpt-enabled micro-teams. Even the famous Joakim Achren jumped on his own App Journey, vibe coding away from the VC world. Should there be even a medium AI bubble stock market *pop*, the longevity of apps\u2019 business models will be put into question. Low barriers to entry will mean even further increased competition. In the meantime, mobile games have had a tough year. AI has created firing-hiring gloom for employees, but is yet to drive more than tactical productivity improvements for most companies. But sentiment could soon change. Many mobile studios that are downsizing will find these people creating new teams, despite the current industry funding challenge. Because just like apps - you don\u2019t need to raise $1-2m in seed funding to get a good prototype. Just don\u2019t expect AI to find the fun for you, that\u2019s still the hard bit. Will we get a new breakout Social Gaming Platform? Game distribution is becoming ever harder. Back in the day\u2026 as an up-and-coming developer you might get some featuring from Apple or Google\u2026 and benefit from chart position downloads. Now, unless you get seriously creative, you need to master creative UA algo-manipulation- particularly on Applovin. Isn\u2019t it time for us to have a new breakout Social Gaming platform \u201cin the West\u201d. Facebook launched the likes of Zynga and King (who remembers when they used to be called Midasplayer?). Youtube\u2019s HTML5 games never really took off; nor did TikTok\u2019s version of it. Twitch, Kick & Youtube Live are great for watching, but there is nothing that enables mass-multiplayer. Jussi Laakkonen\u2019s Noice made a valiant effort, but despite significant funding, it never took off. I hear Discord\u2019s game platform struggles to monetise well at scale. Changes beckon at TikTok, where the US Government will be part of the consortium to soon run TikTok\u2019s US operation. Will that create one of those unique moments that spawns a new platform? Could multiplayer (mobile) gaming be part of that story? Pieter Kooyman, Founder & CEO, Half Moon Studios Creators replace attribution Mobile games will lean harder into creator driven awareness and community building as paid channels keep losing clarity. Games that integrate creators early in the lifecycle will grow faster because they can build trust, social proof, and demand before launch. Marion Balinoff, Influencer Marketing Consultant Collaboration, community, and the new organic UA Game Crossovers as Organic UA Levers: As traditional user acquisition channels face limitations, 2026 will see cross-game collaborations evolve from a pure monetization tactic to a key engine for organic growth. Developers will stop viewing partnerships as isolated events, and instead leverage them as opportunities to drive new engagement among untapped player segments \u2013 something we\u2019ve seen firsthand through Subway Surfers\u2019 collaborations with Crossy Road, Brawl Stars, and more.Embracing Authentic UGC on Socials: In 2026, polished and informative social media content will take a backseat to authentic player-led storytelling, with studios actively incentivizing user-generated content that interprets game mechanics in unexpected ways. Games\u2019 social media channels will increasingly shift from formal corporate messaging to amplifying community trends, turning unexpected gameplay moments and memes into lasting brand affinity. Mathias Gredal N\u00f8rvig, CEO, SYBO From apps to ecosystems - everyone will get to play a part In 2026, I think we will see mobile games evolve from isolated apps into always-on, socially driven ecosystems. I think we will note a shift in how players participate, not just how they play. Creator-led content and livestreamed gameplay -already growing on platforms like TikTok-will become an increasingly important part of mobile game design, with games integrating tools for shareable moments, community challenges, and lightweight UGC. AI will reshape the mobile experience even more aggressively than on PC or console. I would expect smarter personalisation: difficulty that adjusts in real time, dynamic content drops, AI-generated quests, and rapid creative iteration that lets studios test high numbers of ad and content variations weekly. This will make mobile games feel more tailored, fresh, and constantly updating. Economically, rising UA costs will push developers toward loyalty mechanics, stronger social loops, and deeper connections between the game and a player\u2019s wider digital life. Mobile titles will rely less on one-off downloads and more on long-term communities that boost retention through social belonging and creator influence. In short, 2026 will likely be the year mobile games become more social, more personalised, and more co-created; built as living ecosystems rather than standard static apps we are used to.\" Ada Mockute Jaime, CMO, Nordcurrent 2026 will reward studios who hold, not hunt My top prediction is that 2026 will see a decisive shift in marketing focus, moving budgets from User Acquisition to Retention and Retargeting. For years, rising CPIs have made traditional UA prohibitively expensive. The key driver for the 2026 strategy is simple economics: re-engaging a known user via RT is significantly cheaper than acquiring a new one. Savvy gaming studios will embrace a \"retention first\" mindset, based on two core strategies: Lower cost, higher LTV: Retargeting users who have already shown interest dramatically lowers costs, simultaneously increasing the lifetime value (LTV) of the existing player base. Smarter personalisation: Investment will flow into LiveOps and personalisation tools that use first-party data to build deep loyalty, moving beyond mass-market advertising towards highly tailored, in-game user journeys. This shift represents not just a trend, but a strategy for sustainable growth in what we know to be an extremely competitive market. Vera Manhoso, Gaming Account Director, RTB House UA moves from installs to value From my perspective, I am not seeing any radical change coming in 2026. It will largely be an extension of what we have witnessed in 2025. The market will continue maturing, with consolidation favoring larger studios that have the resources to invest in quality development and diversified global distribution. The dominance of Google Play and Apple App Store in game distribution has been questioned extensively throughout 2025. This trend will continue into 2026, with alternative and direct distribution channels growing in importance. I expect traditional players to take more drastic measures to counter these emerging threats to their market control. User acquisition strategies in 2026 will evolve further with a strong focus on player retention instead of simply chasing install volumes. Developers will prioritize maximizing lifetime value through more personalized and gameplay-focused acquisition campaigns. This shift will drive higher engagement and deliver better returns on investment for studios.\" Ahmad Shaquib, COO, GamingonPhone MONETIZATION The ad stack goes adaptive Studios will continue moving toward an integrated growth loop, where UA, monetization, and retention work as a single system rather than separate functions. The priority is shifting from pure acquisition to deeper activation, sustained engagement, and maximization of lifetime value.Hybrid monetization will keep maturing and strengthen its position as the core model for sustainable mobile revenue. Rewarded video will remain the most stable and high-performing format. In parallel, immersive in-game advertising is expected to grow as brands increasingly explore native integrations that don\u2019t interrupt gameplay and can even enhance realism.AI adoption in AdTech will accelerate, especially in bid-floor automation, dynamic pricing, fraud and ad-quality control, and churn prediction. This will enable more efficient revenue tuning, reduce wasted impressions, and improve overall player experience.Looking ahead, we expect to see a shift from static ad rules to dynamic, personalized ad intensity. AI can help predict a player's ad tolerance, churn risk, optimal ad timing, and preferred formats \u2013 ultimately enabling individualized ad strategies instead of a one-size-fits-all approach. Katerina Maliaran, Head of Ad Monetization, Burny Games The year monetization becomes modular: rewards scale, bundles win, AI builds the tools 1. Rewarded Play ExpandingIn 2026, rewarded play shifts from a niche monetisation add-on to a more mainstream component of mobile game economies. There is a growing cohort of users that are enjoying exchanging their time for real world value in a fun way. At our studio, doubling down on rewarded design has helped double our revenue in 2025 and we have bigger expectations for 2026.2. Hybrid Monetization Evolves Into Reward BundlingFor most, the future isn\u2019t ads OR purchases - it\u2019s both. Rewarded videos, subscriptions, offerwalls, streak rewards, and soft-currency boosts now work together as a unified system. This \u201creward bundling\u201d approach expands monetisation to every user type, from ad-first players to light spenders, lifting overall LTV without harming UX.3. AI Tool BuildingWould be daft not to mention AI as a trend. I think most would talk about the way it helps with art/code to produce games, but for me I'm excited by the reality of it already helping us build internal tools that would usually take months or extra hiring to do. e.g. we have built a build tracking web app that measures the roll out states of each build, plus an AI chatbot tool that improves our support function. AI is allowing creative thinkers to build things themselves, which I am really bullish on. Paul West, Founder, Fumb Games Personalisation becomes the product Mobile monetization will shift from rewarding progress to rewarding individuality. We\u2019ll see more personalized offers based on player interests and spending patterns, and the biggest revenue drivers will come from self-expression rather than power. Players will pay to stand out \u2014 not to outscale others, but to be unique, recognizable and true to their own playstyle. Maksim Amosov, Head of Monetization, Nekki 2026 isn\u2019t a monetization reinvention - it's a tightening In 2026, I don\u2019t expect any radical upheavals in the mobile games market. Major players will maintain their positions, while the barrier to entry will continue to rise: the battle for user attention, traffic costs, and increasingly high product-quality expectations make launching new projects ever more resource-intensive.Alternative payment systems may capture 25\u201330% of the mobile gaming market.I expect to see the first projects created primarily with generative AI \u2014 from content and assets to game balance. The share of AI-generated ad creatives will grow significantly, enabling studios to test hypotheses and optimize UA faster and at lower cost.Classical ad monetization will remain stable, and the overall balance of power is likely to persist, though unexpected mergers in the spirit of Unity+IronSource or AppLovin+MoPub are still possible.My main expectation is explosive growth of the intrinsic in-game ad format. After Google AdMob\u2019s entry into this segment, the format may finally achieve mass adoption.As a result, 2026 is more likely to be a year of consolidating the current market model than the beginning of a new era. Daniil Sadykov, Head of Ad Monetization, MY.GAMES Your game can earn more\u2026 if it annoys players less Whether a studio wants to increase player loyalty to grow LTV, raise awareness to launch a web shop presence or build brand partnerships to cash in on the opportunities where community and commerce converge, studios will have to demonstrate they know, understand and respect their audience best. It starts with data, and in 2026 this is where AI will take its cue from players\u2019 behaviorial and contextual signals to deliver smarter segmentation across the journey. It\u2019s valuable insight that elevates the experience, driving more frequent interactions and more opportunities to turn player focus into positive outcomes for studios and their business partner ecosystems. But achieving sustainable growth in 2026 will not only require more inventive monetization models fed by more advanced models. It will demand studios take more responsibility for the ad experience their app delivers. When data shows that exposure to one bad ad will drive 1 in 5 players away from the game, it\u2019s clear that enforcing policies to control harmful (translated: misogynistic), annoying (translated: unskippable) and malicious (translated: scams) ads is a must to keep players playing and brand partners committed. In 2026, studios that stay in the game will be the ones that do more than evolve. They expand their definition of what a game is, what a game does, and what a game owes the player. Peggy Anne Salz, Content Strategist & Founder, MobileGroove LIVEOPS The AI LiveOps divide: architects vs. spreadsheet survivors In 2026, AI will unlock unprecedented liveops capabilities: predictive LTV, churn modeling, offer personalization, dynamic difficulty adjustment, real-time pricing, and economy balancing will all be within reach. But 'within reach' is not 'turn-key.' The tools will exist. The APIs will be accessible. The difference will be in who knows how to wield them. Studios with AI-fluent liveops teams\u2014people who understand how to leverage AI and in what ways\u2014will compound their advantages. They'll optimize their games better, reduce costs, and speed up development. Studios without that expertise will adopt the same tools and get mediocre results. They'll blame the models or worse\u2014ship automations that damage their games. The AI skill gap will become the new liveops capability gap. The real unlock isn't the technology. It's orchestration: AI agents that manage entire workflows end-to-end\u2014scheduling events, populating battle passes, rotating storefronts, triggering contextual offers\u2014collapsing what once required a team of operators into a single PM's strategic oversight. This is still emerging, but the studios building toward it now will be ready when it matures. The liveops role won't shrink. It will bifurcate. PMs who master AI will operate as architects: designing systems, running bold experiments, and shaping player journeys with ambition the old operational grind never permitted. Those who don't will find themselves automated into irrelevance\u2014or left managing the spreadsheets their competitors have long since abandoned. Joseph Kim, CEO, LILA Games Adaptive LiveOps will take over In 2026, I believe a dramatic reshaping of UA and Liveops in the games will take place. AI can help enable real-time personalisation, offers, and UA creative rotation based on user intent signals. The biggest shift likely won\u2019t happen in terms of how UA is being run but from the abilities to dynamically retain and re-engage high value users using behavioural data, contextual targeting, and predictive churn scores. Stefana Pesko, Director of Performance Marketing, Product Madness 2026 belongs to LiveOps: hybrid-casual gets deeper, smarter, and always-on I expect 2026 to be shaped by bite-sized hybrid-casual games with deeper engagement loops and a stronger emphasis on always-on live ops. AI-driven personalization and segmentation will play a bigger role across the board, factoring in not just payer behavior but difficulty, progression, and a wide range of in-game interactions.Revenue will continue shifting toward DTC web shops as teams look for more efficiency in an increasingly mature market. Real growth is likely to come from emerging markets, as the US and EU become more saturated.The ad networks will keep most of the power in an already concentrated ecosystem, though we\u2019re finally seeing early attempts to reduce that dominance. Alexey Gusev, Head of Growth, Softgames PRODUCT + ALT GROWTH Faster tests, smarter games: 2026 favours AI-driven creators By 2026, mobile games will evolve into far more adaptive and player-centric experiences. At Hungry Studio, our Block Blast! development philosophy has always been rooted in rapid iteration and evidence-based design. With AI, this approach will accelerate dramatically: A/B testing will become significantly more efficient, monetization will adapt to each player\u2019s behavior in real time, and creative production for UA will scale faster than ever.The studios that can combine strong product intuition with AI-driven experimentation will define the next generation of global hits. Jason Wang, VP of Brand Marketing, Hungry Studio Stores open up, regulators close in An exciting year is behind us! App stores have opened up and in more than one way! We already saw the effects and the rise in DTC. That will only continue in 2026. On the other hand, regulators keep pushing the industry towards the edge. Apple and Google will start with age verification in the US states, Texas, Utah, and Louisiana, from 1st January 2026, and they have already announced they will pass this info onto publishers (this might become a norm in more states and/or the EU moving forward). Judging by the lack of response from the industry, publishers intend to do nothing with that information - in the context of adapting their content, IAPs or ads in line with the age information they receive. At least for now, or until regulation is enforced further. Bo\u017eo Jankovi\u0107, Head of Ad Monetization, GameBiz Consulting Goodbye static levels, hello living worlds By the end of 2026, I think mobile games could start to feel \u201calive\u201d. Characters react to how you play, every time you open the app the world will have changed, and it\u2019s possible that the use of AI generates dynamic difficulty that can adapt in real time. We may start seeing that it will be more about games that can grow with us in our skill level. Tina Shaw, Creative Director, Activision From cohorts to individuals - personalisation finally gets real In 2026, I would love to see how hyper-personalisation is finally becoming a thing. This has been advised for many years now, but with the current boom of generative AI, this next step for mobile games and apps could become reality. Imagine an onboarding experience that was just made for you. Paywalls, messages, and every form of communication that is not only based on hard-coded rules anymore but tailors the experience to each user individually. Picture a subscription app that adjusts its pricing page to highlight the exact features you care about most or a fitness app that builds a weekly plan based on your real behavior instead of averages. Even content feeds could reorder themselves in real time so every user sees the version of the app that matches their goals, habits, and motivation. And in mobile games, imagine levels that change layout, enemies, and rewards based entirely on how you played the last session, so every run feels uniquely yours. Sven J\u00fcrgens, App Growth Consultant & Advisor More stores, more control, more meaningful growth Looking ahead to 2026, I am confident that mobile games will continue to lead global entertainment. The industry is shifting toward more intentional growth: stronger product quality, better retention loops and a clear focus on long-term player value. I see studios moving away from chasing scale at any cost and prioritising sustainable, measurable growth instead. This mindset is reshaping the approach that everyone will be taking in the upcoming year (or even years). Store diversification is becoming a core strategic pillar. The expansion of third-party and regional stores are providing developers with more choices than ever. It brings additional complexity, but it also unlocks new audiences, new promotional opportunities and more control over distribution. This direction will define how studios think about scaling in 2026. Non-traditional user acquisition will be one of the main growth engines. Creator-led funnels, cross-brand collaborations and experiential marketing have big potential for growth in the upcoming year. These approaches not only improve performance but also build community and emotional connection with players. In a landscape where classic performance channels are less predictable, this blend of creativity and data will set successful studios apart. Elizaveta Savenkova, Chief Business Development Officer, ZiMAD Ad network mediations on top In 2026, I think we will see a lot of exciting innovation around ad network mediations. CK Wang, Co-founder & CEO, Kooapps D2C graduates to main character in 2026 In 2026, we\u2019ll see D2C shift from side experiment to core infrastructure. The playbook is emerging: design it into onboarding from day one, model conversion rates into your UA strategy the same way you track retention gates, and segment your approach. Studios executing on this are recapturing significant revenue per paying player and feeding it directly into LTV, which unlocks more aggressive UA. By the end of 2026, that structural advantage will separate the winners from everyone else. Spencer Tucker, Chief Product Officer at Stash 2026 looks like a year of refinement and optimization rather than disruption. Based on my experience in mobile gaming BD, growth, and monetization, here are my predictions for 2026:1. AI will gradually enhance live-ops and personalizationStudios won\u2019t replace teams with AI, but they will increasingly use it to support segmentation, content testing, and decision-making.2. Hybrid monetization will continue to gain tractionMore developers are exploring mixes of ads, IAP, and subscriptions, not as a radical shift, but as a steady, data-driven evolution.3. Cross-platform play will expand where it makes senseWe\u2019ll likely see more titles connecting mobile with PC or cloud versions, especially in mid-core and social genres.4. Community and creator influence will keep growingShort-form video, user-generated content, and niche creators will remain important discovery channels.Overall, 2026 looks like a year of refinement and optimization rather than disruption.

Innovative hybrid titles are bringing it on. Copycats will be there, though! Globalisation is pushing us in a good way!\ud83e\udda7 \u00d6mer Yakabagi, Founder, Gamigion Mobile becomes cross-media IP In 2026, mobile gaming will evolve from a companion experience to a central hub of entertainment ecosystems. With Europe\u2019s mobile gaming market expected to generate $33.1 billion in revenue in 2025, mobile-first studios are poised to drive the next wave of transmedia franchises, blurring the lines between games, film, music, and social platforms. We\u2019ll see more mobile-led IPs that expand across media formats, driving both narrative and commercial growth. This isn\u2019t just gamification, it\u2019s the redefinition of how stories live and evolve. With the rise of 5G, cloud gaming, and AI-driven personalization, mobile platforms will rival consoles not only in performance but in cultural influence. Next year, mobile gaming won\u2019t just connect players - it will connect industries, reshaping what a franchise means in the era of interactive, always-on storytelling. As policies evolve and new regulations open doors for mobile studios, developers now have greater opportunities to engage directly with players, doing so with higher profits and less complexity. This shift will lead to more games delivering value and creating unique, enriching experiences for their audiences.

      "content": "For years, app monetisation discussions have focused on fill rates, eCPMs, and demand sources. But one critical variable has often been treated as a necessary evil: ad quality. As user expectations rise and competition intensifies, that trade-off is becoming increasingly dangerous. In the latest edition of App Talks, David Murphy spoke with Alex Yerukhimovich, GM at AppHarbr, about why ad quality is no longer a secondary concern and how bad ads quietly erode retention, revenue, and trust across the app ecosystem. Why ad quality is becoming a growth problem Alex describes ad quality as a user experience issue first, not a monetisation one. Users don\u2019t distinguish between app content and ad content. To them, everything that appears on screen belongs to the app. That perception creates a fundamental risk for publishers. When ads feel deceptive, disruptive, or malicious, users don\u2019t blame ad networks, they blame the app itself. As Alex explains, this problem has traditionally been most visible in gaming, where high-paying formats like rewarded video have historically justified aggressive ad behaviour. But the challenge is now spreading rapidly into non-gaming apps, where user lifecycles are longer and retention is far more valuable. The three types of bad ads AppHarbr categorises ad quality issues into three core buckets: The first is unwanted content \u2014 ads or landing pages that are violent, inappropriate, or simply off-brand for the app. The second is bad ad behaviour. These ads may look fine on the surface but disrupt the user experience by playing loud audio, triggering vibrations, or hijacking the screen with unskippable full-screen formats. The third, and most dangerous, category is malvertising. These ads are intentionally deceptive, designed to manipulate users into handing over personal or financial information. Common examples include fake virus alerts, false system warnings, scam investment promotions, and AI-generated deepfake endorsements. According to AppHarbr\u2019s recent data, one in every 77 ads served in gaming apps is malicious. In non-gaming apps, it\u2019s roughly one in 120 \u2014 a gap that is narrowing fast. Ad quality is hurting retention and app revenue Source: Business of Apps via YouTube The hidden cost of \u201cletting it slide\u201d One of the biggest misconceptions Alex highlighted is the belief that bad ads are tolerable because they pay well. In reality, publishers rarely know whether that\u2019s true. Without full visibility into their ad inventory, publishers can\u2019t see what happens when a bad ad is blocked. In most cases, Alex says, the second-highest bidder fills the slot at nearly the same price, without damaging the user experience. The real costs of bad ads show up elsewhere: Shortened sessions when users close apps early Higher churn and uninstall rates One-star reviews that hurt ASO and future installs Long-term damage to brand trust and lifetime value For apps with long-term usage \u2014 weather, finance, live scores, utilities \u2014 losing even a single loyal user due to ads can outweigh short-term monetisation gains. From blind spots to full transparency AppHarbr\u2019s core mission is to give publishers full visibility and control over the ads shown in their apps. Alex points out that while some ad networks and mediations provide limited reporting tools, most developers still can\u2019t confidently answer basic questions like which ad verticals dominate their inventory or where quality issues originate. The first step is transparency, or knowing exactly what ads are being served, by which networks, and how users are exposed to them. The second step is enforcement, or the ability to block or reject problematic ads in real time, without relying on slow or incomplete third-party responses. A smarter ad ops workflow Beyond protection, ad quality tools unlock new operational and optimisation opportunities. With granular control, publishers can: A/B test blocking specific ads or advertisers Segment enforcement by OS, country, or user type Balance UX improvements against real revenue impact Customise ad experiences for different user cohorts This allows teams to move away from one-size-fits-all monetisation strategies and toward a more nuanced balance between revenue performance and user satisfaction. Why good ads actually help monetisation Alex is clear that ads themselves are not the enemy. Good ads \u2014 relevant, clearly dismissible, well-timed, and non-deceptive \u2014 enable free content and sustainable business models. Users are willing to engage with advertising when it respects their time and attention. The goal isn\u2019t to remove ads, but to make them safe, transparent, and predictable. The bigger picture As ad quality continues to deteriorate across the ecosystem, Alex argues that passive acceptance is no longer an option. Solving the problem requires both better tooling and a more vocal industry response. Publishers, platforms, and ad tech providers all share responsibility. If bad actors are consistently blocked and exposed, the incentive structure shifts, improving outcomes even for smaller developers who lack leverage on their own. The takeaway Ad quality isn\u2019t a monetisation edge case anymore. It\u2019s a core growth variable. From retention and reviews to revenue stability and brand trust, the ads inside an app are inseparable from the app itself. As Alex succinctly put it, if the ads in your app are bad, your app is bad.

      "content": "In this article, S\u00f8ren H. Dinesen, CEO of Digiseg, explores the complex world of AI in politics, its benefits and risks, and examines why oversight and regulation are crucial for preserving democracy. In an era where technology shapes our daily lives, generative AI has emerged as a powerful force in the political landscape, and its role is both revolutionary and potentially dangerous. With generative AI, politicians can create targeted campaign ads, amplify campaign messages, and engage voters, but there\u2019s a downside. Consider how AI can also be misused for creating convincingly fake campaign ads, disseminating disinformation, and turning voter outreach into voter manipulation. Dive in as Dinesen delves into the complex world of AI in politics, examining its benefits, risks, and the urgent need for regulation to protect the integrity of democratic processes. Generative AI and Politics OpenAI certainly changed the world in November 2022 when it introduced ChatGPT, the first popular and widely available generative AI tool. Public reaction was varied. Many warned it was the end of numerous careers (indeed, the Hollywood writers\u2019 strike was partially due to fear that ChatGPT would eliminate their jobs). And a great many experts worried that ChatGPT would usher in a new era of fake news, disinformation, and more believable scams as generative AI can create text that feels legitimate to the average person. This isn\u2019t an idle fear as one study found that large language models (LLMs) can outperform human authors in terms of convincing people. Election officials are sounding the alarm over the use of generative AI in creating political ads, phony but convincing campaign fundraising letters, as well as orchestrating voter outreach initiatives. These officials weren\u2019t wrong; we\u2019ve already seen generative AI used for such purposes. In January 2024, registered Democratic voters in New Hampshire received fake Joe Biden robocalls telling them not to vote in the primaries so that they could save their vote for November. This is not to say that all use cases for generative AI in the political sphere are nefarious. Many legitimate political parties and candidates see generative AI as a useful tool in amplifying the impact of their political ads. For instance, they can use it to deliver highly targeted ads at the household level, including those encouraging voter turnout. In fact, generative AI can help less-resourced campaigns compete against well-funded ones. That said, generative AI can (and likely will) have harmful impacts on elections across the world, and it\u2019s well worth our time to be aware of its dangers, and take steps to mitigate them. Insufficient Oversight in AI-Generated Political Ads There\u2019s no doubt that AI can create high-quality text that many people and voters find quite credible. But therein lies the danger. Most reasonable people assume that the ads they hear or see have been endorsed by a campaign and vetted by the media source that runs them. In the US, radio and television ads end with the candidate saying, \u201cI\u2019m [candidate name] and I approve this message.\u201d Internet-based ads are exempt from this disclosure requirement, a loophole that the Honest Ads Act of 2017 sought to close (it didn\u2019t pass). Today, few regulations require political ads to disclose the role of AI in their creation. The one exception is the EU AI Act, which classifies AI systems used to influence voters in political campaigns as \u201chigh-risk\u201d and therefore subject to strict regulations. The United States government has failed to enact a national AI disclosure law, even as the 2024 presidential election looms. In the absence of a national law, a dozen or so states enacted laws regulating the use of AI and deepfakes (more on that later) in political advertising and requiring disclosure. Those states are California, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin. Additionally, Google said last year it would require AI disclosure on political ads, and Meta soon followed suit. But there are challenges to these efforts. Common Cause, an advocacy group focused on promoting ethics, accountability, and reform in government and politics, says the Florida law is too weak to be effective as it imposes fines, but no mechanisms for removing offending ads. In Wisconsin, the Voting Rights Lab warns that the state law is too narrow, regulating only candidate campaigns and not special interest group ads. The bigger challenge is that it\u2019s up to the ad creators to self-disclose, an unlikely event for people bent on fear-mongering, and even if an ad is deemed violative, it will still be in circulation for it is spotted and identified. In other words, AI-generated ads with misinformation will still have ample opportunities to be seen and believed by a great many voters. Generative AI Hallucinations Another challenge is AI hallucinations. Most AI tools warn the user that responses may contain incorrect information (see graphic below), which means a campaign may willingly or inadvertently create campaign ads containing false information. This isn\u2019t a theoretical concern. Research from a European non-profit organization, AI Forensics, found that one out of three answers provided by AI was wrong. Microsoft\u2019s Bing search bot gave wrong answers when asked basic questions about elections in Germany and Switzerland, often misquoting its sources. In the United States, misleading and incorrect responses from chatbots threaten to disenfranchise voters. AI-generated responses told users to vote at locations that don\u2019t exist or aren\u2019t official polling stations. Columbia University tested five AI models, and all failed to provide accurate responses to basic questions about the democratic process. In the U.S., misinformation about voting times and locations is a tried-and-true voting suppression tactic, so it\u2019s concerning that generative AI will allow its practitioners to be more effective. Inherent Bias of Generative AI All AI is trained on data; the accuracy of the AI is wholly driven by how well the training data is vetted and labeled. Data is often inherently biased for many reasons. In the political sphere, LLMs are trained on news stories that concern elections and candidates, but liberal news sites block AI bots as a matter of course, whereas right-wing ones welcome them. The result is that the AI models are trained on data skewed to a particular point of view that may not reflect a total body of opinion. Going further, some people intentionally seek to influence the responses of a chatbot. In 2023, The New York Times reported that David Rozado, a researcher in New Zealand, used prompt engineering to create right-wing ChatGPT. This revised chatbot was intentionally designed to give right-wing answers Political Manipulation Perhaps the biggest concern is that AI will be used to manipulate the voter, as the fake Biden robocalls sought to do. This isn\u2019t a new fear, of course, as we\u2019ve seen AI used in political manipulation long before the widespread availability of ChatGPT. For instance, in the 2018 midterm elections in the US, election officials were warning voters to be aware of deep fakes. To raise awareness of just how realistic deep fake videos can seem, Oscar-winning filmmaker Jordan Peele created a video in which a fake Barack Obama says \u201cstay woke.\u201d The message is clear: don\u2019t believe what you hear on the internet. Despite the warning, deep fake videos and images appear in the media. In June 2023, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s presidential campaign shared fake AI-generated images depicting Donald Trump embracing Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and someone who Trump came to loathe. Trump supporters targeted African Americans with fake AI images, as part of a strategic ploy to convince voters that Trump is popular among Black voters. Deep fakes also played a key role in the 2023 Argentine elections. Candidate Sergio Massa\u2019s team created a video featuring his main rival, Javier Milei, describing the revenues that could be gained by selling human organs and suggesting that parents could consider having children as a \u201clong-term investment.\u201d Despite the video\u2019s explicit AI-generated label, it was quickly shared on different platforms without disclaimers. Over in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s staff shared a video depicting his main rival, Kemal Kili\u00e7daro\u011flu, receiving the endorsement of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, a designated terrorist group. Although this video was clearly fabricated, it didn\u2019t stop voters from viewing and sharing it widely. Given what we\u2019ve already seen occur, it\u2019s no surprise that election experts call generative AI a \u201cpolitical super-weapon.\u201d Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, takes it one step further, saying that AI poses \u201cepoch-defining\u201d risks, including the widespread proliferation of disinformation. When People Aren\u2019t Real: The Rise of Bots & Psychochats There\u2019s one final threat to consider: AI posing as humans to sway how people think and ultimately vote. Once again, nefarious players have access to sophisticated tools to help them deploy their schemes. For instance, bots have been effective at disseminating disinformation with a great deal of speed and efficiency. In 2019, The New York Times reported that Epoch Media Group created over 600 fake media profiles, all featuring profile photos generated by AI. Those profiles were then deployed to distribute fake news and disinformation. It\u2019s not that hard to come up with AI-generated profile pics; a simple Google search serves up numerous sites allowing you to create realistic headshots and photos for social media. These bots can then be used to engage with voters who may be on the fence or provide people, who are intent on voting, to go to a non-existent polling station. Psychochats goe one step further. These are avatars of candidates and are deployed online to interact with potential voters. It\u2019s only a matter of time before psychochats are used by campaign opponents to spread misinformation on their rivals, similar to Sergio Massa\u2019s smear campaign against Javier Milei. Think this is too outlandish to be true? Politico reports that Meta is already experimenting with licensed AI celebrity avatars. And, Hello History invites users to \u201chave in-depth conversations\u201d with historical people of the past. Democracy in Peril: Why We Must Act When elections are marked by rampant misinformation, the very foundation of democracy is compromised. At the end of the day, misinformation leads to the formation of governments formed under false pretenses. Chaos results when governments lack the necessary legitimacy to govern effectively. The erosion of trust brought on by deep fakes, AI-generated lies, and psychochats undermine the democratic process, ultimately threatening the stability of societies. Never has it been more important to protect the integrity of information during election cycles. AI tools are cool and offer tremendous benefits to everyone in the digital media industry. But we must also acknowledge their potential for abuse, and work tirelessly to control how they\u2019re used.

      "content": "SHAPING WHAT\u2019S NEXT IN MEDIA Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 SECURE YOUR SEAT Marketing The latest ads.txt fraud: the 404bot By Seb Joseph \u2022 February 25, 2020 \u2022 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Ads.txt files were supposed to help the ad industry stamp out fraud but instead, they\u2019re increasingly a conduit for it. The tool was launched three years ago by the IAB\u2019s Tech Lab as a way for publishers to list all of the companies that are authorized to sell their ads. Essentially, the text file shows when an advertiser buys ads either directly from a publisher or an approved ad tech vendor as well as highlight those sites that do not use an ads.txt file or if inventory is being sold without a publisher\u2019s approval. In theory, ads.txt files help advertisers avoid illegitimate sellers who arbitrage inventory and spoof domains. The reality, however, is the files are also fertile ground for fraudsters. Since the ads.txt tool launched, fraudsters have exploited the fact that buyers don\u2019t always check the lists with bots that generate fake browser data and create fabricated URLs in order to pilfer media spend. The latest example of this type of fraud is called the 404bot. The 404bot is essentially domain spoofing, which is when fraudsters impersonate a publisher\u2019s webpage. But with the 404bot, there is no inventory. Instead, there\u2019s a 404 error page in place of the webpage spoofed. The inventory appears like a legitimate buy from an authorized seller when in fact there\u2019s nothing. Since the 404bot was first noticed by Integral Ad Science in 2018, it has pilfered more than $15 million in ad spend from 1.5 billion video ads sold by large and small publishers across the U.K., the U..S, Canada and Australia. It may not sound like much given the average individual fraudster makes between $5 million and $20 million dollars a year, but the implications of the 404bot go beyond headline figures. The existence of the 404bot is symptomatic of how ads.txt lists are being used as a plaster to ward off the symptoms of fraud rather than to help heal the cause of it. Publishers list ad tech vendors in their ads.txt files even when they no longer work with them because they want to avoid showing ad buyers that they rely on unauthorized resellers to drive demand for their inventory. Plus, the more authorized sellers a publisher has, the more money they can potentially generate. Advertisers, on the other hand, either don\u2019t have the internal expertise to push publishers to audit their ads.txt lists or won\u2019t because doing so could theoretically reduce the scale of buys they could make. Meanwhile, ads.txt files continue to get longer and subsequently become easier places for fraudsters to hide. The longer the ads.txt list, the harder it is to audit for unauthorized sellers. \u201cI\u2019ve seen ads.txt lists that have more than a thousand ad tech vendors on them,\u201d said one media executive. Indeed, the only link between all publishers that were impersonated by the bot was that they all had long lists of ad tech vendors in their ad.txts files, according to IAS. In fact, when the ad verification firm worked with publishers to vet the exchanges selling their impressions, instances of the 404bot \u201cweren\u2019t as rife,\u201d said Victoria Chappell, vp of marketing for IAS across EMEA and APAC. \u201cWe cannot provide a specific number to define a large number of resellers, but this discovery brings the question, are publishers vetting their resellers? If they are not, it will defeat the core purpose of ads.txt\u2019s existence,\u201d said Chappell. The 404bot isn\u2019t the first time ads.txt files have been hijacked by fraudsters. Bad actors have tried to worm their way on to publisher\u2019s ads.txt files since the tool launched in 2017. \u201cThese types of fraud are successful because they prey on the fact that companies selling and buying media aren\u2019t set up properly to audit what\u2019s being traded,\u201d said Dan Larden, managing partner of product and partnerships at programmatic agency Infectious Media. \u201cProgrammatic advertisers need to be pushing ad tech vendors for more log-level data so that they can see where the wastage is on the media that\u2019s being bought.\u201d Share Copy \u00d7 Share this article Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Trending in 01 Marketing on Platforms TikTok\u2019s confirmed U.S. deal still leaves unanswered questions 02 The Creator Economy TikTok moderation has pushed some news creators to the limit Sponsored Here\u2019s what a bigger \u2014 and more fractured \u2014 2026 World Cup means for advertisers 03 Business of TV Programmatic advertising on TV is set to increase this year Most Read 01 Marketing on Platforms TikTok\u2019s confirmed U.S. deal still leaves unanswered questions 02 The Creator Economy TikTok moderation has pushed some news creators to the limit 03 Business of TV Programmatic advertising on TV is set to increase this year 04 WTF Series WTF is liquid content? 05 Content & Commerce \u2018Things have changed\u2019: Diageo pulls retail media upstream More in Marketing View More Generative AI \u2018Our marketing is not a bullshit machine\u2019: Why Perplexity is investing in targeted, organic growth January 30, 2026 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Perplexity is banking on its name carrying weight to keep current users engaged and attract new ones Brands in Culture As AI catches on across luxury, brands play up their emotional value January 30, 2026 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit At Shoptalk Luxe, vendors and brands alike described deeper AI integration than ever before.

      "content": "Monday, January 26th, 2026 \u2013 12:28 pm SHARE: Most publishers have no idea that a major part of their video ad delivery will stop working on April 30, shortly after Microsoft shuts down the Xandr DSP. For publishers that rely on Prebid and Google Ad Manager, the effects could be immediate and costly. When an advertiser wins a video ad impression in a Prebid auction and the publisher uses Google Ad Manager (GAM), Google runs a secondary auction that compares the Prebid bid against bids from its own demand stack. If the Prebid bid wins, GAM calls for the video creative to be served. This all happens in microseconds. But for that brief moment before GAM makes the final auction decision, an intermediary must host the video ad file coming from Prebid. To date, these storage costs have always been taken care of on behalf of publishers, initially by AppNexus, then by Xandr within AT&T and, now, by Microsoft Advertising, which bought Xandr in 2021. But, as of the end of April, Microsoft Advertising will no longer pay to cache those Prebid video ad files as, essentially, a public service. Caching Prebid video files will now be part of Microsoft\u2019s paid ad tech offering. \u201cIn the last year, Prebid.js has released the capability to use local caching, which provides a better user experience and reduced network requirements, but we wanted to give the community more time to make this update to their implementation,\u201d a spokesperson for Microsoft Advertising told AdExchanger. Microsoft Advertising also delayed the deadline from January 31 to April 30. This pending change to Prebid\u2019s video ad serving is actually a big problem, despite the deadline extensions, although you wouldn\u2019t know it from the next-to-no attention it\u2019s received from most publishers and SSPs. When Microsoft announced the change last August, \u201cthey probably thought they were giving everybody a lot of time,\u201d said Patrick McCann, SVP of research at Raptive, a Prebid board member and chair of Prebid.js, the organization\u2019s deeply in the weeds developer group that produces the open-source codebase. Subscribe AdExchanger Daily Get our editors\u2019 roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Daily Roundup Daily News Roundup Cadent Gets Direct; Curating YouTube, Netflix-Style Microsoft already gave a three-month extension. \u201cBut what happens in ad tech, as is often the case, is that people wait for the absolute deadline,\u201d McCann said. So, what happens now? In short, many video ads that are served via Prebid and GAM will result in a VAST error, meaning no video will appear. The auction will work and tags might indicate an ad was served, McCann said, but there will be no video file available to play. Other Prebid video caches exist, but not for free. Some SSPs and exchanges offer storage as a paid option for clients. Ian Meyers, director of engineering at The Trade Desk and a co-founder of Sincera, noted in a LinkedIn post last month that the Microsoft Advertising cache accounts for more than 60% of Prebid-to-GAM video ad impressions. Around four in every five US sites that allow ad serving use GAM, per multiple estimates. So if 60% of Prebid video ad coverage in that supply chain is affected, a vast (no pun intended) number of actual ads could end up misfiring \u2013 as in, not firing \u2013 on pages come February. And don\u2019t expect some other company to volunteer to fill Microsoft\u2019s shoes. McCann estimates the monthly cost of caching Prebid video ad files for GAM auctions at between $50,000 and $250,000. But those numbers are for now. As Prebid\u2019s overall adoption grows and video ad products develop, caching costs will naturally rise \u2013 potentially reaching seven figures a month within a few years. The fix There are technical workarounds. A bunch of SSPs and video ad networks, including Magnite, PubMatic, Mediavine and JW Player, already offer Prebid video caching as a paid option for clients. But in order for them to work, publishers need to wake up and take action. Even if SSPs and exchanges agree to cover caching costs for their clients, each publisher in the supply chain still must make a change to its site and Prebid setup so GAM points to the correct source. Another option \u2013 one which Prebid is exploring in its JavaScript working group \u2013 is to use what in JavaScript parlance is called a BLOB (\u201cbig local object\u201d). The Prebid Local Cache, as the product is called, is a simpler system, according to McCann, because there\u2019s no need for back-and-forth calls between Prebid, Microsoft and GAM. It\u2019s a sort of \u201chack\u201d of the GAM system, McCann said. GAM doesn\u2019t support BLOB creative units, he explained, so the Prebid Local Cache gives GAM \u201cwhat it thinks is an HTTP location for the URL,\u201d which then redirects to the BLOB. If all this sounds wildly confusing, don\u2019t worry. BLOB is not an acronym you\u2019ll need to know. And, hey, header bidding started out much the same way. Before header bidding became a standard practice across the industry, it began as a \u201chack\u201d of a GAM advertising data field. The Prebid Local Cache feature takes a similar approach, albeit in this case to get GAM to accept Prebid creatives. But because of that workaround, it doesn\u2019t function with Google IMA, which is the multimedia ad library Google uses for most sites and apps. As a result, publishers that adopt the Prebid Local Cache could see their AdX revenue decline between 40% and 80%, as per McCann. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to work with the AdX team to try to get that revenue back,\u201d he said. Raptive is leading development of the Prebid Local Cache, alongside early testers, including Freestar and gaming platform CrazyGames. Cache me if you can On the other hand, relying on a vendor to cache video files, as AppNexus and its corporate incarnations have done, has risks as well. For example, if a user loads a webpage and doesn\u2019t scroll right away, the cache can expire before the video is triggered, causing the ad to fail to play. Even someone scrolling too slowly down can cause video ad failure because of a caching issue. Meanwhile, despite Microsoft\u2019s vast resources, periods of high traffic or strained capacity have occasionally bogged down the system or prevented real-time caching altogether. Every extra call and ping between Prebid, Microsoft and GAM creates more \u201cpoints of failure\u201d that can prevent a video ad from serving, McCann said. Which is why the Prebid Local Cache and BLOB strategy is more efficient, he argued, despite the severe drop-off in AdX demand. But the underlying issue with the Prebid Local Cache might just go away. After all, Google could \u201cdevelop first-class-citizen support for BLOBs,\u201d McCann said, meaning local caching would work without costing publishers so much of their AdX revenue. It is also possible that GAM integrates with Prebid at some point. It\u2019s not a coincidence that this problem exists only within Google\u2019s publisher ad tech. Because Google remains the main holdout from full Prebid participation, every must be hacked and reverse-engineered in order to work. Those inefficiencies have already cost the third-party ad tech industry many millions of dollars, and will cost tens of millions more in unnecessary file-hosting fees. As the issue stands, though \u2013 and with the deadline at the end of April \u2013 publishers that use Prebid and serve video ads have important questions to answer and a time-sensitive to-do list to tackle. There are other companies that cover the Prebid caching fees for their clients, as Microsoft will do, too. But even that doesn\u2019t actually solve the problem. \u201cEven transitioning your creatives over to point to the new vendor is a lot of work that publishers may not know how to do at the moment,\u201d McCann said. Many publishers first set up their Prebid servers years ago and aren\u2019t constantly tinkering with their ad server settings. \u201cMaking these changes, whether it\u2019s switching to a local cache or a new caching vendor?\u201d McCann said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to assume [it\u2019s] daunting for publishers.\u201d Tagged in: appnexus // Bid Caching Fees // featured // JavaScript // Microsoft Advertising // prebid // Raptive // Xandr",

      "content": "SHAPING WHAT\u2019S NEXT IN MEDIA Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 SECURE YOUR SEAT Media Confessions of a Fake Web Traffic Buyer By Jack Marshall \u2022 November 12, 2013 \u2022 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Online advertising has a fraud problem. Millions of ad impressions are being served to bots and non-human traffic, and ad tech companies are doing little to stop it. Digiday spoke with a former publishing executive who said he knowingly purchased fraudulent traffic and sold it on to advertisers in the past year. In fact, it was his former company\u2019s business model. Here\u2019s what he said: How and why were you buying non-human traffic? We were spending anywhere from $10,000 to $35,000 a day on traffic. My conversations with [these ad networks] were similar: They would let me decide how much I was willing to pay for traffic, and when I told them $0.002 or below, they made it clear they had little control over the quality of traffic they would send at that price. Quality didn\u2019t really matter to us, though. As a website running an arbitrage model, all that mattered was profit, and for every $0.002 visit we were buying, we were making between $0.0025 and $0.004 selling display ads through networks and exchanges. The biggest determinate of which traffic partner we were spending the most money with was pageviews per visit. Since we were paying a fixed cost per visit, more pageviews equaled more ad impressions. Almost none of these companies were based in the U.S. While our contacts were in the US and had American names and accents, most of the time we found ourselves sending payment to a non-US bank. How did you know the traffic was bots? These vendors offer a range of services and traffic types \u2013 everything from $2.00 CPC traffic sourced from Google, Yahoo, and Bing, to $0.002 CPC from god knows where. When we told them we were looking for the cheapest traffic we could possibly buy there would be sort of a wink and a nod, and they\u2019d make us aware that for that price the traffic would be of \u201cunknown quality\u201d. How much you pay determines how much bot traffic you\u2019re getting, so when you\u2019re paying $0.002 a click, you\u2019re getting mostly bots. You can tell it\u2019s bot traffic just by looking at the analytics. We\u2019d see a traffic spike in our real-time analytics dashboard and then we would see all of our traffic for the day serve in a couple of hours, Or it would all come from users using the same really old version of Internet Explorer. Almost all our users had Flash versions from 2003, according to Google Analytics. That just doesn\u2019t happen with real users. Were you just serving display ads to this traffic? We tried playing around with video a little. A network came to us said they\u2019d pay $4 CPM for 2 million daily autoplay impressions. While we were eager for the chance to make an extra $100,000 of incremental profit per month, it turned out the bots couldn\u2019t render video players. We\u2019d send bot traffic to pages with video content but they couldn\u2019t load our player. They were set up to fool display ads, but weren\u2019t as tuned for other types of advertising. It seemed as if they were optimized to load pages, load display ads and not much else. Can you prove categorically that you were buying bot traffic? Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t go out and prove categorically that these were bots. We couldn\u2019t find a smoking gun. We knew beyond a doubt that it was non-human traffic, but we just couldn\u2019t find a conclusive way to prove it. Do you think publishers know when they\u2019re buying fake traffic? Publishers know. They might say \u201cwe had no idea\u201d and blame it on their traffic acquisition vendor, but that\u2019s bullshit, and they know it. If you\u2019re buying visits for less than a penny, there\u2019s no way you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. Any publisher that\u2019s smart enough understand an arbitrage opportunity is smart enough to understand that if it was a legitimate strategy that the opportunity would eventually disappear as more buyers crowded in. What we were doing was 100 percent intentional. Some articles revolving around bot traffic paint publishers as rubes who were duped into buying bad traffic by shady bot owners. Rather, I believe publishers are willing to do anything to make their economics work. Do networks, exchanges and other ad tech companies do anything to stop this from happening? We worked with a major supply-side platform partner that was just wink wink, nudge nudge about it. They asked us to explain why almost all of our traffic came from one operating system and the majority had all the same user-agent string. There was nothing I could really say to answer that question. It was their way of letting us know that they understood what was going on. It wasn\u2019t just our account rep, either. It was people at the highest levels in the company. Part of me wished they\u2019d said \u201cYou are in violation of our TOS and you have to stop running our tags.\u201d I would have been happy with that. But they didn\u2019t; they were willing to take the money. Do you consider buying suspect traffic fraud? I consider it fraud. It violated the terms of service in our contracts with our partners. When you begin a relationship with ad exchanges and other partners normally you have to identify the sources of your traffic and disclose if you are doing any traffic acquisition. In theory they maintain the quality of their traffic. In reality they just turn a blind eye. How common do you think this is? I think there are a lot of people who knowingly do it. If you can do it with one site you can do it with 10 sites, which means a lot of traffic and ad impressions. For ad exchanges and networks it\u2019s a meaningful part of their business, and that\u2019s what\u2019s more egregious to me. It\u2019d be so much easier for them to see which publishers are doing this if they wanted to. If they just looked for sites where traffic increased 500 percent from one hour to the next, that\u2019d be a good place to start. There are so many ways they could police this, but the incentive just isn\u2019t there.

Prophesy Unfulfilled Oracle Advertising, we hardly knew ye. Moat, we forgot all about you. Pour one out, because today marks the end of the road for Oracle\u2019s advertising and third-party data businesses, including BlueKai, Datalogix, Moat and Grapeshot. Retailers, credit card and financial services, TV manufacturers and any other company with first-party data and a claim to captive audiences are betting big on ad revenue. But \u201cfirst-party data\u201d and \u201ccaptive audiences\u201d are the important parts. Oracle has neither. As a data aggregator and only a partner to media companies and retailers, no data or inventory originated with Oracle. When Facebook removed third-party data sellers in 2018, it was \u201cthe end of the gravy train,\u201d as multiple former Oracle Data Cloud employees told AdExchanger in June, when Oracle announced it would fold the group by Q4. Now a new gravy train is in motion. Contextual advertising companies are after the Grapeshot business, while Integral Ad Science and DoubleVerify in particular enjoy an unexpected tailwind. Moat had many blue-chip clients bundled in with the overall Oracle data warehouse. Digital advertising is a realm of giants. It\u2019s not often the little guys get to feed on a whale. Wouldn\u2019t Touch It With A 10-Foot Poll The internet was supposed to be the ultimate political polling tool. Forget pestering people in grocery parking lots; now you have a finger on the pulse of real-time America. That dream did not pan out, The New York Times reports. The biggest political pollsters \u2013 Pew, Reuters/Ipsos and Gallup \u2013 all went big on online, opt-in data. But each abandoned the idea after 2020. For one thing, digital data is misleading. ZIP codes are an intuitive way to hone respondents by state or district. But that approach turned out to be flawed. Social media, search and programmatic ads are big drivers of online political surveys. And that opt-in data is often way off, too. Alabama is a highly populated state, per paid media surveys. Probably because it\u2019s atop alphabetical drop-downs. People submit garbage info to jump to the next level of a mobile game or collect some incentive from the polling firm. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly difficult to say whether and when opt-in polls are worthy of consideration, especially when alternative, traditionally collected data is available,\u201d writes NYT\u2019s chief political analyst, Nate Cohn. Home mail and landline phones it is. The future is bright. Happy As A Pig In Slop The internet has a slop problem. Not spam or phishing or anonymous trolling or any of the other very real afflictions on the web. But slop is the term for the recent promulgation of AI-generated stories, posts, pictures and even videos. At New York Mag, writer Max Read cites the publisher of Clarkesworld, a fiction submission magazine, who saw hundreds of stories come in that were clearly AI-generated slop. On Facebook, Instagram, X and other social platforms, content that is obviously created by ChatGPT or a similar AI service is shared everywhere. Read speaks to one slop purveyor in Kenya who operates some 170 popular Facebook pages by prompting ChatGPT things like: \u201cWRITE ME 10 PROMPT picture OF JESUS WHICH WILLING BRING HIGH ENGAGEMENT ON FACEBOOK.\u201d But it isn\u2019t just social feeds built for viral sharing. Google Books was infiltrated by AI slop. Job and resume boards are swarmed by slop. And the AdExchanger team can assure you that many PR firms are turning to generative AI to craft pitches.

But it also includes aesthetic elements like color selection and fonts. Mobile app design focuses on making apps look and feel great so that users come back to them. At its core, mobile app design applies UX and UI in symbiosis as the drivers of engagement, retention, and increased profitability. Mobile app design also includes a choice of frameworks for effective delivery. One example is Human-Centered Design (HCD), as defined by the founder of the Nielsen Norman Group, Don Norman. They define the HCD process across four stages: Understand and address the core problems Be people-centered Use an activity-centered systems approach Use rapid iterations of prototyping and testing Most successful mobile app designs will apply a structured framework to design, like HCD. But they will also include robust UX and UI. When the average app loses around 77% of Daily Active Users (DAUs) in the first three days post-install, UX and UI can drive user action and long-term profit. But let\u2019s first understand more about these two elements and define their positions in the mobile app design process.

UX design Mobile app UX design is about creating meaningful experiences for users. It\u2019s the process of deciding how someone might use an app and then using research outcomes to inform app design. UX designers must engage in data-driven design principles that include extensive user research and data collection, before reviewing their impact on branding, app engineering, and usability. UX will have a focus on functionality but with the intention to build it around the emotions of app users. Research by Dirin, A. and Laine, T.H. (2018) defines UX as \u2018the emotions the user encounters when using either a service, a product or an application\u2019. This recognition of emotional engagement comes from design thinking principles, which focus on users\u2019 needs. Good UX should therefore be user-centered and promote emotional engagement. To be successful in enticing users into having an emotional experience, some considerations UX designers need to factor in include: Screen size and orientation Navigation style e.g. scrolling or swiping Accessibility levels for people with disabilities or impairments Potential for offline and online use, found in omnichannel retail experiences Ways the app promotes frictionless user experiences UX is a critical component in the mobile app design process. But let\u2019s also consider how it sits next to UI design. UI design Mobile app UI design is about how an app looks and feels. The UI process includes decisions on visual presentation and strives to create a consistent style and appealing look. UI designers take the UX designer\u2019s work and create an intuitive, consistent, and easy-to-use interface that\u2019s aesthetically pleasing. UI design also has a focus on promoting more emotional engagement by converting UX designs into comfortable and pleasing-to-use apps. As a checklist to ensure UI designs fulfill all requirements, Nielsen and Molich set out ten rule-of-thumb UI design principles: Visibility of system status: Users should find it easy to see screen functionality. Match between the system and the real world: Users should understand the app language. User control and freedom: Allow users to go back and undo or redo actions. Consistency and standards: Standardize features and ensure consistency. Error prevention: Design and create systems so errors are minimal. Recognition rather than recall: Offer help and consider users\u2019 short-term attention spans. Flexibility and efficiency of use: Let customers tailor and customize their app. Aesthetic and minimalist design: Keep designs simple and free of clutter. Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors: Use plain language that guides users towards easy resolution of problems or system errors. Help and documentation: Ensure how-to documentation is easy to find and helpful. Now there\u2019s a clearer view of the use of UX and UI, let\u2019s move on to understanding more about why application design is essential. Why is application design important? Mobile app design is important for many reasons. Users expect a quality app experience and to receive something that improves their life. Good design can also build customer loyalty and improve brand reputation. But it\u2019s the ability to increase profitability and ROI from better user engagement and retention that sits at the heart of application design. When app use first became popular, many sites redesigned web UX for app usability. And this proved effective by boosting conversion KPIs by over 80%. Today, app design powers new trends that designers must keep a handle on. For instance, Mobile Augmented Reality, or MAR is growing in popularity by powering omnichannel retail experiences. Lazaris, C; Vrechopoulos, A; Doukidis, G; and Fraidaki, A (2015) found that\u2013thanks to an ability to promote Augmented Reality in a natural way\u2013smartphones and mobile apps were the most suitable device for driving in-store sales. So retailers who want to retain customers may drive loyalty and higher sales with MAR application designs that can blend mobile in-store and online experiences in a frictionless way. Plus, MAR achieves around 94% higher conversion rates and sees 60% of usage in-store. Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) Market Size Predictions \u2013 2021 to 2026 Content-focused experiences, Face ID, and multi-directional navigation are also becoming more popular. And in every instance, creating a custom UI design that meets the specific needs of app users while driving engagement is key. One way mobile app designers can uncover the right approach to custom UI and UX design is through data-driven design models. And we will review those in the next section.

Data-driven design models help mobile app designers understand current trends and best practices. They improve the quality of UI by making predictions about UI design performances which lead designers toward more adaptive and appropriate UIs. Biplab, D; Huang, Z; Franzen, C et al. (2017) set out a case example of Rico \u2013 the largest repository of mobile app templates. With datasets of over 70,000 unique mobile app designs mined from a variety of operating systems and sources, designers can benchmark their work against others. Rico, therefore, acts as a convenient form of Quality Assurance or as a means to guide development, offering five categories of mobile app designs to review: Design Search: Designers can find design examples to inspire or better understand possible solutions. Searches may include app flows, 3D modeling, and web design. UI Layout Generation: Researchers can generate probabilistic models of UI layouts while combining screenshots with view hierarchies to investigate optimal visual features. UI Code Generation: Coding is time-consuming, but Rico enables reverse engineering to reproduce the visual look of a target interface. User Interaction Modeling: Rico contains data on how users interact with apps, what they click on and when they check out. All of this is useful to inform development. User Perception Prediction: A dataset can help to predict user responses but gleaning data on users\u2019 first impressions of app screens or images. Data-driven design models can increase the quality of UI and UX and improve engagement and retention. Using these models, designers can find inspiration for their own designs and ensure UX and UI is appropriate to the app\u2019s context. So, whether it is omnichannel retail, e-commerce, social networking, or training and education, data-driven design modeling can improve strategy and increase success in the marketplace. Mobile app design guidelines With a better idea of the importance of mobile app design, let\u2019s move on to discuss some of the steps needed for successful mobile app design and development. This basic guide will offer insights and resources on developing mobile app design ideas. Through a series of key steps, we\u2019ll reveal how to work towards attracting and retaining customers while supporting long-term profitability. Define the app\u2019s objective The initial stage of the mobile app design process is ideation. But coming up with the right idea and plan needs a solid and robust preparatory approach. The following points can help with defining the value proposition, which should take center stage in any plan: Problem identification and clarification of how the app solves it Highlighting pain points the app needs to address Defining what the app does and how the app could affect users Reviewing competitors USP definition \u2013 what makes it different or special Many app designers find a Business Model Canvas can represent their ideas and help them to form a plan. Osterwalder & Pigneur (2010) defined the Business Model Canvas to help start-ups find their business model as fast as possible. It centers on the value proposition as the central focus and can help to speed up the process. It\u2019s also helpful when clarifying the concept with UX designers. Business Model Canvas: Osterwalder & Pigneur 2010 Make a business plan With the idea and value proposition formed, app designers should consider how these elements will inform a business plan. A good way to address this is via a business plan template, which may include the following headings: Executive summary Company overview: To highlight the app sector, industry, and company stats Customer, competitor, and industry analysis: To reinforce the USP definition Marketing and operations plans: Should include brand positioning and marketing strategy Management team: Key players/individuals and their role in the company Financial Plan: Including profit & loss, balance sheet, and cash flow A business plan should be clear, simple, brief, and professional. It\u2019s the document everyone will refer to during the mobile app design process. Conduct competitor analysis As part of a business plan, it\u2019s important to research the competition. One way to identify competitors is by sorting them into appropriate subcategories. The Gartner Magic Quadrant is often used as a competitor analysis template. And it can help to review players in a given market. The Magic Quadrant divides competitors into four boxes: Leaders: Execute well against their vision and are well-positioned in the market. Visionaries: Understand market movements and have a vision for changing the rule. Niche Players: Focus on a smaller segment and can\u2019t outperform others. Challengers: May dominate the market but don\u2019t yet understand its direction. Create user personas The next phase to unpack is user personas. This is where the mobile app design process uses UX to glean customer insights so it can offer a usable, attractive, and competitive app. Customer personas should assess customer behaviors and create fictitious profiles of typical users. Coming up with names and descriptors and defining behaviors or attitudes can help to optimize UX designers\u2019 approach to user experience. AIBY mobile app company state that what matters most about personas is not their social or demographic characteristics but their goals, motivations, and frustrations. And that it\u2019s these three aspects that allow for the creation of a general set of personas. Wireframing Wireframing is a useful way to validate app design basics and features. And it is often seen as a critical way to create a blueprint for app design and execution. During the wireframing process, it\u2019s helpful to consider ways to make app screens and interactive elements familiar and predictable. For example, Risa Nakajima is a Berlin-based app designer who used a three-stage wireframing process in the mobile app design process for Swipy, a German language learning and vocabulary app. Stage one commenced with paper wireframing followed by mid-fidelity wireframing via Adobe XD, using grayscale to focus on checking functionality. Risa completed the wireframing process with a UI design phase via high-fidelity wireframing. Swipy mid-fidelity wireframing using Grayscale Source: Risana Kajima Hire an app design team Hiring a dedicated web development team can bring many benefits. Whether it\u2019s a group of committed software developers, designers, engineers, or specific individuals, these specialists can often work alongside in-house staff. And they may bring benefits such as flexibility, scalability, and better access to specific skills and talents. The types of skillsets to look out for in a design team include: Competence in UX and UI design demonstrated by an outstanding portfolio Ample experience in responsive design for iOS and Android operating systems Image edition skills using software like Photoshop/Illustrator Fundamental HTML and CSS skills Knowledge of Sketch, Adobe XD, Affinity Designer, or Figma. There is also the option to buy in or subscribe to mobile app design software and companies. Design the app With the preparatory work complete, it\u2019s time to proceed with the design process for the app. If applying Human-Centered Design principles, designers may focus on matching users\u2019 needs. But they should also try to optimize usability. Mobile app designers should look out for visual consistency on things like interactive elements, interface buttons, and fonts. By keeping pages clean, and clutter-free, with minimal notifications, mobile app designs can promote usability. Designing screens for users with impaired vision, hearing, or movement limitations will ensure accessibility. Plus, designers can enhance their work using mobile app design software tools such as Balsamiq, FlowMapp, or Sketch. Test the design The test phase is very important since apps that appear with a clunky or bad interface risk early user abandonment. But with a well-planned UI and a user-centered approach, this testing phase should set the app on course for attracting users, securing their loyalty, and sustaining their interest. All of which will lead to increased ROI and success. Designers should also consider running usability testing with a variety of mixed-user focus groups. These can include diverse users of large or small group sizes and rapid interval testing. And the process should help to uncover any usability issues such as bugs or errors in the app\u2019s interface. Track and monitor performance The final stage should include a water-right review of the performance of the app design. It should include taking any insights gleaned and using them to fix glitches and bugs. Developers should monitor any feedback including online reviews and ratings to enable testers to act on them fast. Continued app releases are helpful to resolve bugs and fix usability or feedback issues. With a full understanding of how to go about designing an app, and the principles to include in the process, let\u2019s now move on to show you some key examples of app designs in the form of templates. Mobile app design templates In this section, we\u2019ll showcase key examples of mobile app design templates that may help with benchmarking your own mobile app design process. From meaningful screen transitions to simple, clean landing pages, this section may help with considering the most appropriate mobile app design ideas. Well-defined landing page A well-designed and responsive landing page will support better brand awareness while improving conversion rates and lead generation. With its smart clean branding and logo included on the landing page, investment app Acorn does its best not to overdo the app\u2019s theme. It features minimal buttons and a focused design with a mix of perspectives and moving parts that don\u2019t overwhelm the user. Also, the font is simple, clear, and small enough to leave plenty of white space for navigation buttons. Acorn App \u2013 Landing page example Source: Acorns Simple navigation Navigating an app can range from search tools to voice navigation to the humble hamburger. In every style, designers should keep things simple and uncluttered. Simplicity increases user engagement when designs are simple and in line with app usability. One classic example of simple navigation is Google\u2019s Material Design Bottom Navigation Bar. Offering easy access to user journeys, the Material Design Bottom Bar allows for consistency and easy accessibility. Google\u2019s Material Design Bottom Navigation Bar Source: Material Design Meaningful screen transitions Appropriate transitions between screens can reinforce UX and lead to better long-term retention. But whichever screen transition a designer chooses, it must have a meaningful impact on the user. For example, a slide transition allows pages to appear underneath when the user might want to revert back to it. But push transitions let users knock a page out of sight using the touchscreen, giving it the appearance of being trashed. So, whatever the transition, mobile app design must be intuitive and allow page transitions to align with the general look and feel of the app experience. Example of slide page vs. push Source: invisionapp.com Simplified User Interface (SUI) A famous psychological study conducted by Iyengar, S.S. and Lepper, M. R, (2000) demonstrated how more plentiful items can attract more customers, but with low conversion rates. Instead, when shoppers see fewer items for sale, it attracts fewer customers but more of them will buy the products. In other words, app conversion rates are higher when users have fewer options. This study reinforces the benefits of Simplified User Interface (SUI) graphics. To explain more, SUI ensures screens only include features important to the context of the app or screen. It replaces unimportant screen elements with simple shapes and lets users focus on the most important parts of the screen. An SUI mobile app design template is perfect for user onboarding and instructing users on how to access individual features. Example of an SUI template Source: techsmith.com Strong visual hierarchy Creating a strong visual hierarchy in mobile app design helps users move across the interface and understand what\u2019s important. By ranking design elements using size, scale, color, contrast, and placement, designers can influence usability in an intentional way. Also, by using different patterns, perspectives, and spacing of elements, designers can boost usability and ease of use. This, in turn, can lead to increased engagement and retention and promote longer-term profitability. Example of visual hierarchy from The New York Times app Source: justinmind.com Better accessibility Dark mode is a recent trend that can help to reduce eye strain. But it also promotes better accessibility for people with neurodiverse conditions like dyslexia. By dimming the background screen, people with dyslexia can find it easier to access words on a screen. Dark mode may also save energy and extend battery life while lengthening an OLED display\u2019s lifespan. Dark Mode Example Source: ionare.medium.com MFA or 2FA (Multi-factor or Two-factor authentication) Two-factor authentication is a standard security process to protect users against identity theft and fraudulent attacks. Apps should integrate 2FA and promote easy and simple usability. For example, research from Google rates SMS as one of the most effective ways to block 99% of phishing attacks, along with automated bots and other targeted attacks. Designers can also consider using a separate authenticator app to take the place of SMS. For example, LastPass Authenticator is available for Android, iOS, and Windows. LastPass Authenticator MFA Screen Shots Source: Geekflare App design best practices You should now have a clear understanding of mobile app design principles and the data behind them. But to recap what we\u2019ve shown in this piece, here\u2019s a summary of the key best practices: Apply a structured framework such as HCD to boost usability, engagement, and profitability. Use consistent and on-brand aesthetics to attract and retain app users. Good UX should promote emotional engagement. Follow Nielsen and Molichs\u2019 ten rule-of-thumb UI design principles. Consider data-driven design models to review current trends and benchmark existing designs. A Business Model Canvas can help to represent ideas and form a plan of action for application design. Do the groundwork. Spend time on competitor analysis, persona development, and wireframing. Hire an app design team with the expertise and experience needed for your app idea. Keep app designs simple, easy to navigate, meaningful, and focus on evoking an emotional response from users. Consider accessibility and security. Test and validate your app through regular monitoring. Final thoughts Good mobile app design can determine an app\u2019s profitability and ROI. So designers should aim to provoke an emotional response in users by placing UX and UI at the heart of application design. With a strategic approach to design that draws on UCD principles and meets users where they are, app developers can create successful apps. And, by focusing on the needs and emotions of users and adapting designs to meet them, app designers can improve their chances of success. Along with the inclusion of innovative, and data-driven templates, mobile app designers can also attract new users while encouraging loyalty using strong mobile app design techniques.",

      "content": "SHAPING WHAT\u2019S NEXT IN MEDIA Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 SECURE YOUR SEAT Marketing on Platforms Snapchat has a bad ad problem, but buyers aren\u2019t fazed By Digiday \u2022 January 15, 2019 \u2022 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit For years, Snapchat has been heralded by publishers and ad buyers for its brand-safe environment, driven by the fact that Snapchat Discover has the benefit of an exclusive set of publisher partners supported by human editors. But these days, Snap\u2019s ad network is not so protected. As Snapchat has grown its self-serve ad system, the company has opened itself up to bad actors and scrutiny \u2014 but don\u2019t expect that to impact marketers\u2019 Snap budgets just yet. On Jan. 11, Holly Archibald, a 21-year-old actor from Scotland, tweeted screenshots of a Snapchat ad that directed to a fake-news story about celebrity Chrissy Teigen promoting weight-loss pills. Teigen tweeted about 80 minutes later that she had asked the company \u2014 which could mean the publisher The Panda Readers or the product Keto Fit Premium \u2014 to remove the story. In response to the ad, Snap removed the ads, suspended the advertiser and reached out to Teigen\u2019s management, a Snap spokesperson told Digiday. The company is working to build technology to stop such violations and grow the teams that address the situation, the spokesperson added. This is not the first instance Snapchat has been in trouble for a bad ad. In fact, Teigen cited a Snap ad that made light of Rihanna\u2019s domestic violence among her reasons to stop using Snapchat in March 2018. Ad buyers said the existence of an ad promoting fake news reflects poorly on the platform. Kerry Perse, managing director of social at Omnicom media agency OMD, said that Discover is no longer the highly curated space that it used to be. \u201cOne of the reasons advertisers were drawn to the Snapchat Discover platform was because the content was highly curated and reviewed for editorial quality. While we certainly understand the need to scale the amount of content and number of influencers featured in the Discover section to attract more audiences with broader interests, we would love to see the same safeguards put in place to preserve the desirability of the inventory,\u201d Perse said. Others also called for more brand-safety measures from Snap as the company aggressively tries to build its ad business. Jeff Ratner, chief media officer of iCrossing, said he would like to see Snapchat invest more in its brand-safety efforts. \u201cWhen you consider stewardship and protection, the bar continues to be raised in terms of how an aggregator and social network has to look after its consumers, advertisers and supermodels. It is yet to be seen whether or not Snapchat has the tools and sophistication in place to do that successfully,\u201d Ratner said. But don\u2019t expect the situation to provoke advertisers to stop spending on Snapchat. Some are attributing the fake Teigen ad as growing pains that come with a digital ad business that\u2019s still growing. Snap reported revenue of $298 million for the third quarter of 2018, up 43 percent compared to the previous year. In May, Snap touted that 95 percent of Snap ads, excluding Story ads, were programmatic. \u201cSnapchat is experiencing the challenges of moving toward an automated self-service model, including the need for better processes and controls when it comes to reviewing and approving ads on the platform,\u201d said Joshua Lowcock, global brand safety officer at UM. Troy Osinoff, co-founder of digital marketing agency Juice, said he\u2019s had a great last quarter with ads on Snapchat, noting his clients had up to 60 times return on ad spend on Black Friday. \u201cUnfortunately, fake news isn\u2019t going anywhere, and there is paid spend on it across all platforms. From Taboola to Facebook, this isn\u2019t a problem exclusive to Snapchat. We\u2019ve seen some amazing results from Snapchat over the last few months. We can\u2019t penalize our clients because these ad platforms aren\u2019t 100 percent full-proof against fake news,\u201d Osinoff said. Snapchat users might not feel the same way. Snap declined to share where the ad appeared. Archibald, who spotted the ad, told Digiday she did not remember which publisher\u2019s edition it was in. \u201cIt was properly advertised as an article with just another clickbait title by Snapchat, and then once clicked, it became clear that it wasn\u2019t an article at all but was just a completely fabricated ad for this keto product,\u201d she said. The Teigen ad is providing yet another reason for users to abandon Snapchat, just like Teigen did last year. Archibald told Digiday that Snapchat users like herself should not have to be propositioned with scams and be forced to see these types of weight-loss narrative when using social media. \u201cI\u2019d honestly just encourage [Snap] to look at how they restrict and regulate these ads \u2014 if they even make an effort do that at all \u2014 because so many people are fast losing respect for them as a company and platform,\u201d she said.

After the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fined long-time, and billionaire, influencer Kim Kardashian for failing to disclose an Instagram endorsement paid for by a crypto company, some think the broader influencer sector could face more scrutiny. On Monday, the SEC announced it had reached a $1 million settlement with Kardashian over her 2021 post promoting the crypto asset EthereumMAX. Although the post mentioned the often used \u201c#Ad,\u201d the agency said Kardashian should have also included that she was paid $250,000 for the post. As part of the settlement, Kardashian has agreed to also not promote any cryptocurrency for three years, according to the SEC, and will also be required to pay an additional $260,000 in disgorgement. \u201cThe federal securities laws are clear that any celebrity or other individual who promotes a crypto asset security must disclose the nature, source and amount of compensation they received in exchange for the promotion,\u201d Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, said in a statement about the settlement. \u201cInvestors are entitled to know whether the publicity of a security is unbiased, and Ms. Kardashian failed to disclose this information.\u201d Although the fine is a drop in the bucket for Kardashian, it also opens new questions about whether federal regulators are more willing to go after social media influencers and celebrities alike. Over the past few years, several celebrities have settled with the SEC after promoting cryptocurrencies without proper disclosures. In 2018, the agency settled with boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and music producer DJ Khaled after they failed to disclose their payments related to promoting Centra Tech, a company that was charged by the SEC with deceiving investors out of tens of millions of dollars as part of a proposal to create a virtual currency debit card. In 2020, actor Steven Seagal settled with the agency over failing to disclose payments from B2G. Alexandra Roberts, a law and media professor at Northeastern University, said professional influencers like Kardashian know not to skip disclosures and should be penalized when they don\u2019t. However, when it comes to micro-influencers, it should be the responsibility of the company hiring them to make sure they\u2019re educated and that disclosures are in place. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder to brands that there are rules and there will be scrutiny,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd also a reminder to the general public that when you see people shilling these investment opportunities or brand that they\u2019re talking about that you should think of them like you would think about traditional TV ads.\u201d In 2016, the group Truth In Advertising (TINA) released a report that found more than 100 instances where Kardashian and her celebrity sisters didn\u2019t follow the FTC\u2019s endorsement guidelines. More recently, TINA has investigated beyond the Kardashians. In August, the organization released a report claiming that more than a dozen celebrities have promoted NFTs on social media without properly disclosing their relationships with various companies and projects. Laura Smith, TINA\u2019s legal director, said it\u2019s frustrating to see celebrities \u201ccontinue to flout the law,\u201d but also encouraging to see the SEC taking the issue of undisclosed promotion seriously. \u201cDeceptive marketing sells,\u201d said Smith, adding that \u201cuntil there are costs with deceptive marketing\u2026 if it\u2019s still profitable, it will continue.\u201d Kardashian and Mayweather are also co-defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in January, which claims they\u2014along with former Boston Celtics player Paul Pierce\u2014promoted EMAX as part of a \u201cpump-and-dump scam.\u201d \u201cWe see the SEC order as validation of the claims in the EthereumMax litigation, particularly those against Defendant Kardashian,\u201d John Jasnoch, an attorney with Scott + Scott LLP, which is representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, in an email to Digiday. \u201cPromotors who mislead investors should be held accountable.\u201d The fines come as another U.S. agency, the Federal Trade Commission, is considering updates to regulations for endorsements and testimonials related to products and services. (The FTC \u2014 which last updated its guide in 2009 before the rise of the influencer industry \u2014 had begun proposing chances in February 2020 but then paused during the pandemic.) Some trade groups including the Association of National Advertisers and the Interactive Advertising Bureau say the FTC\u2019s plans go too far. Others, such as the American Association of Advertising Agencies (the 4As), say they\u2019re more in line with the proposals. Lartease Tiffith, the IAB\u2019s EVP for public policy, said that the trade groups have issues with how the FTC\u2019s plans to require influencers to have disclosures that are \u201cunavoidable,\u201d arguing that the definition could be \u201cpretty murky.\u201d Instead, he said, the agency should rely more on the platforms and built-in transparency tools. \u201cFor a lot of influencers, it\u2019s a cautionary tale,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of them get caught in a lot of the crypto NFT type promotions that a lot of people are doing and they have to realize they\u2019re going to be held to a certain standard by the SEC.\u201d Ryan Detert, co-founder and CEO of the influencer marketing company Influential, said the FTC\u2019s requirements are already clear and that disclosures are needed to maintain consumer confidence. \u201cDisclosure is a necessity for consumer confidence and to be FTC compliant,\u201d Detert said. \u201cThese moments remind creators that with great power comes great responsibility.\u201d Influencers are responsible for properly representing themselves and the companies they work with, said Kyle Wong, co-founder and CEO of Pixlee, a content marketing startup. When they\u2019re not transparent, he said they risk their own credibility and regulatory consequences. \u201cThe majority of influencers aren\u2019t celebrities,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThey\u2019re passionate content creators who have built an engaged community based on shared values. Those influencers who have worked to build relationships that emphasize transparency remain credible.\u201d Share Copy \u00d7 Share this article Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Trending in The Creator Economy 01 Member Exclusive Future of TV Briefing: The creator\u2019s economy\u2019s \u2018very loud, dirty little secret\u2019 of brands\u2019 late, delayed payments 02 Generative AI WTF is vibe coding?

Clearly, all over the world people\u2019s attention on mobile is shifting towards TikTok, as the ultimate producer of highly engaging video content that costs zero to produce. In 2019, following the steps of previously established social media giants such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, TikTok launched an advertising platform called TikTok Ads. Having such a big, diverse, and engaged audience as TikTok has, puts the company in a great position to connect brands with audiences. It gives brands a high confidence that they will find those brands\u2019 products and services useful and worth buying. TikTok Ads Cost Statistics Average TikTok engagement rate \u2013 2.65% Average TikTok Ads CPM \u2013 from $3.20 to $10 Average TikTok Ads CPC \u2013 from $0.25 to $4 Minimal spend per campaign \u2013 $500 Price to create TikTok video on Canva \u2013 free TikTok audience\u2019s biggest age group is 18-24 years old (37.3% of the total are male and 18.1% are female) TikTok influencer post pricing ranges from $5 to $2,500+ Initially, TikTok captured the minds and hearts of a young generation (think Gen Z) but, as of 2024, people of all generations watch videos on TikTok, and hence it puts the company\u2019s advertising platform \u2013 TikTok Ads high on the list of digital marketing platforms for every brand.

Moburst is ready for you! Claim Your FREE TikTok Success Audit! Following the phenomenal success of the platform, advertising on TikTok quickly followed. Today, we can talk about two major ways of running ad campaigns on TikTok \u2013 via TikTok Ads platform or via TikTok Influencers. Let\u2019s begin with the former first. TikTok Ads: the cost influential factors & how to reduce it After a few years of work-in-progress, since it was rolled out back in 2019, the TikTok has managed to improve its advertising platform and today its efficiency and easy-to-use are on par with Google Ads or Meta Ads. Obviously, as an app marketer, one of your goals is to increase the app\u2019s user base, while trying to lower expenses. Here is how you can lower your TikTok Ads ad campaign costs. Just like Meta and other popular social media platforms, brands can run ad campaigns either using the TikTok Ads dashboard themselves or choosing to approach a social media marketing agency that, thanks to their expertise, is capable to lower the costs yet meeting expectations for results. For starters, let\u2019s answer the question \u2013 what is a good cpm for TikTok ads? The minimal CPM is $0.50 per mile, meaning marketers pay at least 50 cents for every 1,000 views of their ads. The lower limit for CPC is $0.02 per click and advertisers are obligated to spend $500 per ad campaign. Similar to other online advertising platforms, factors that influence TikTok Ads costs have to do with how efficient are graphic creatives, level of engagement with ads, smart ad testing strategy, and having a robust analytics system in place. Now, the tips for decreasing your spending on a TikTok Ads ad campaign can be split between several buckets. Making authentic TikTok ad creatives One of the most distinctive features of TikTok Ads ad formats is how well they are blended with user-generated content on one hand but on the other TikTok users still can distinguish between ads and videos generated by the users. Just like a regular video, ads can be liked, commented and shared. This visual similarity leads to high rates of engagement because TikTok users do not perceive those ads as advertising. Having said that, for this perfect blending to work, advertisers need to make sure their ads are on par with regular video content. Meaning if an ad wasn\u2019t shot in such well known TikTok visual style, it will be standing out for the rest of the feed on the TikTok app and users will just skip it. On the other hand, if an ad was produced in a true TikTok visual style, it will secure it high level of engagement and will require less of your marketing budget. Partnering with influencers Influencers are brand ambassadors on many social media platforms but TikTok is a special case. Thanks to its For You page section, which is highly visible to TikTok users, influencers are in a great position to engage with audiences and deliver brands\u2019 messages. The important thing to remember for this tip is that you always need to make sure that you approach the right influencers for your brand, the ones that can actually be authentic in a video creative they will be shooting for your TikTok Ads ad campaign. If you fail to meet this requirement, most likely you\u2019ll waste your Influencer marketing budget and won\u2019t be able to bring down your costs. One more thing about video content, generated by influencers for your app\u2019s ad campaign, once your influencer marketing ad campaign is over you can use the same video clips for your ad campaign on TikTok Ads paid ad platform. Using the right ad format TikTok Ads platform provides advertisers with multiple ad formats to use and you need to be familiar with each to make the most of it. The In-Feed Ads format is similar to what Facebook Ads offers advertisers, it\u2019s located directly on TikTok user\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d page and this is the one that is meant to blend with regular video content posted by TikTok users. The Brand Takeover Ads format name speaks for itself, it\u2019s meant to be displayed on the entire app\u2019s screen for a brief period of time (up to 5 seconds) and present brands front and featured to people. This is about as much exposure as it gets. Certainly, this format requires advertisers to be especially careful with their messaging and what that 5-second video ad should deliver within such a short period of time. The TopView format is similar to Take-over but it actually doesn\u2019t occupy the entire screen, only a portion, and in this case, it\u2019s the job of an app marketer to create a message catchy enough to users pause and watch an entire video ad. The Spark Ads format really stands out from the rest because it allows advertisers to make an ad from an existing video that has a high level of engagement and hence has the potential to be an efficient ad. The Carousel Ads format allows app marketers to feature up to ten images, each with its own caption, and appear in the user\u2019s news feed. The Collection Ads format is designed to create a seamless and engaging shopping experience on TikTok. And finally the Hashtag Challenges format \u2013 challenges and hashtags are two major drivers of virality on TikTok and the platform allows app marketers to leverage these powerful tools to run ads. Conducting split-tests Despite app marketers\u2019 best efforts to come up with the most efficient ad creatives before launching the ad campaign, in reality, it\u2019s nearly impossible to achieve therefore running a split-test for a TikTok Ads campaign is a must for app marketers. Running several ads with different creatives at the same time and carefully analyzing their performance allows identifying the best performing ad creative to focus your ad campaign on and hence decrease your costs. You also need to remember that different ad creatives resonate with different audiences and because it\u2019s impossible to know a priori which one corresponds to which, a split test is what helps you establish this connection. Using analytics properly Finally, it\u2019s absolutely essential to analyze carefully every metric provided by TikTok Ads\u2019 built-in analytics and build working hypotheses about why specific ad creative performs in a particular way. The platform provides both a bird-view look at the entire set of ad campaigns running and a deep dive on a campaign level, with filtering and customizing data points available for analysis. Now let\u2019s take a look at the key data points that allow app marketers to assess their TikTok Ads campaigns\u2019 efficiency. To facilitate advertisers to achieve their goals, the auction-based TikTok Ads platform supports a number of business models such as CPM (Cost-Per-Mile or cost of paying for 1,000 ad views), CPC (Cost-Per-Click), CPA (Cost-Per-Action), and CPI (Cost-Per-Install) as a specific case of the CPA model. Aside from these models, app marketers should always remember one of the core principles that underpin any kind of auction-based marketing campaign \u2013 if you bid too low most likely your ads are not getting delivered and if you bid too high your TikTok Ads campaign ROI is definitely out of whack. Now, if controlling your daily cost is more important than achieving a certain number of conversions per day, you should select either Bid Cap or Cost Cap settings in your ad campaign dashboard. If, on the other hand, your TikTok Ads campaign optimization goal is Conversion, then you should select Lowest Cost as your bidding strategy. Finally, if your campaign goal is achieving specific actions by your app users you should select the App Event Optimization setting. We need to mention that despite the TikTok Ads platform has been online since the spring of 2019, very few reliable data sources for the costs associated with it are available. Having said that, let\u2019s take a close look at each bidding strategy available on the platform, starting with CPM. TikTok audiences\u2019 age split Every social media platform\u2019s audience gravitates toward a certain age group, as you can see on the graph below, in the case of TikTok, it\u2019s the 18-24 years old age group. Among TikTok users of this age, 19.5% of the total audience are female and 17.8% are male. Next, with a slight gap, comes users from the 25-34 years old bucket and here we have 16.3% of the total audience are female and 16.6% male. The distant number three are users of the 34-44 years old, with only 7.9% of the total audience being female and 7.8% male. The next two age groups clearly present the minority, only 4.3% of women between age 45 and 54 have a profile on TikTok. For men the numbers even smaller \u2013 only 4% of this age group use TikTok. Finally, people over 55+ are really not into TikTok, only 3.2% of women and 2.5% of men have a profile on TikTok. TikTok audience profile (%) Source: Sprout Social, Growth Devil, Backlinko TikTok users geography TikTok got its start in China but since then has spread around the world and here is what TikTok\u2019s audiences percentage of the total population looks like for various regions. In countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE and Iraq, more than 100% of their population the age 18 or older is on TikTok, meaning individuals of that age have more than one account on TikTok. One half or, to be precise, 50%.7 of the US population is on TikTok which constitutes to 113.3 million people. Vietnam, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Philippines are all above the 40% of their population registered on TikTok.

TikTok users demonstrate a notoriously high level of engagement, it ranges from 4% to 16%. Certainly, different ad formats should trigger different levels of engagement, specifically for the TopView format CTR is 12-16%, Branded Effects Ads generate CTR = ~ 8%, In-Feed video ~ 5%, Branded Hashtag Challenges format is capable invoke around 8% as well. The brand new Collection Ads can deliver 6-8% CTR, and finally Dynamic Showcase Ads can bring app marketers CTR = 4-6%.

If you choose to go via the software route, Canva is the most obvious choice, since Tiktok partnered with Canva in August 2021 to provide Canva\u2019s superior yet easy-to-use graphical capabilities to its advertisers to design visually appealing and efficient ads. Canva pricing consists of three plans \u2013 Free, Pro ($120/year), and Enterprise ($360/year). If you choose the hiring route, you may either hire a freelancer on the Upwork work marketplace. A professional studio-quality video ad creation pricing starts at $500 and up and you should expect it to be ready within 2-3 weeks. TikTok Ads CPM According to the platform rules, the average pricing of the Cost Per Mile starts at $10 per 1,000 views, and there is a minimum cap of $500 per campaign to be spent. Various companies that run TikTok Ads campaigns report different numbers for CPM, based on the performance of their ads targeted to various audiences located in different geographies. For example, TuffGrowth reports the cost of the 1,000 views of the ad on TikTok ads to be $6.06, JungleTopp claims TikTok CPM to be as low as $1.82, the CPM from Lebesque sits in the middle with $3.21.

While AI-driven marketing optimization and analytics solutions company Lebesque data shows TikTok Ads CPC to be $0.50 per click.

However, the crypto exchange platform Kraken has made it the tagline of a new campaign as it seeks to rise above what many see as a broken idea and a shrinking market. Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the oldest Bitcoin exchanges that\u2019s become one of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchanges. Surprisingly, this is its first global ad campaign \u2014 which began this week in the U.S. and U.K. across TV, social media and out-of-home ads, including Tube-takeovers in London. The tone of crypto marketing has changed a lot since the last bull run. While Super Bowl ads last year from FTX and Crypto.com focused on FOMO, others in recent months have shifted to addressing how to fix the ecosystem\u2019s various problems that have been highlighted during the bear market. Now, Kraken CMO Mayur Gupta wants to start what he calls the \u201cthird wave of crypto marketing\u201d to reach future adopters. But can crypto marketing actually help rebuild trust in such a beleaguered category? \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of negativity around what has to be fixed,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cIt\u2019s important, but I don\u2019t think the next billion users are going to jump into crypto only based on what\u2019s broken. Of course highlight what\u2019s broken, but we are also absolutely focused on what are the real life use-cases of crypto, why crypto makes sense, the substance of crypto and not just the surface and the volatility.\u201d In new print and OOH ads, Kraken describes crypto as \u201cborderless, bankless, boringless.\u201d Another promises to \u201cdo for finance what the internet did for information,\u201d while another offers the ability to transact with \u201canyone, anytime.\u201d However, the narration in a new TV ad conveys a more serious tone: \u201cMoney makes the world go round and round and round. The same old problems, the same old story on repeat\u2026What if we could make our system more open, inclusive and transparent?\u201d \u201cUnlike many other verticals, the category of crypto is still in its very nascent stages,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cA billion people don\u2019t wake up every day around the globe saying, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to move away from a traditional bank and self-custody my assets\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m going to buy Bitcoin tomorrow or buy an NFT.\u2019 So we are starting at the top of the pyramid.\u201d The goal is to market the entire crypto category, Gupta said, which requires a lot of education. He cited a 2022 report by Block Inc, which found 51% of people hadn\u2019t bought Bitcoin because they didn\u2019t know enough about it. (Kraken\u2019s other recent marketing efforts include a deal with the Formula 1 team Williams Racing and a collaboration with Kitboga, a Twitch streamer and YouTube creator known for exposing crypto scams.) It\u2019s too early to know whether Kraken\u2019s marketing will yield what Gupta hopes for. But Gartner analyst Andrew Frank said historical examples of major turn-arounds all happened during the era of mass media. \u201cSince digital media outpaced TV, the fragmentation, noise level and distrust of digital media makes it nearly impossible to sustain a mind-changing campaign for long enough to have a mass migratory effect,\u201d Frank said. As rivals spent tens of millions of dollars on ads, Kraken only spent $10,000 in the second quarter of 2022, according to data from Vivvix, which included paid social data from the ad-tracking firm Pathmatics. Although Kraken declined to disclose its advertising budget for the new campaign, it\u2019s spent $3.1 million on advertising since the start of 2021, according to data from Vivvix and Pathmatics. According to the same data sources, four other crypto companies have spent far more on advertising during the same timeframe: The top spender was Crypto.com ($134.9 million), followed by FTX ($93.3 million after adding $4.25 million from FTX.US), Coinbase ($64.3 million) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ($18.9 million). Overall, quarterly ad spending by the top 10 crypto brands totaled $3.7 million in third quarter of 2023, $12.1 million in Q2 and $3.1 million in Q1. For comparison, last year crypto brands spent $121 million in Q1 before dropping to $35.8 million in Q2, $19.2 million in Q3 and $11.2 million in Q4. Timing and trust The timing of Kraken\u2019s campaign is also noteworthy, if not actually questionable: It\u2019s launching midway through the high-profile trial of FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who allegedly defrauded the rival crypto exchange\u2019s customers and investors. (Observers pointed out the trial\u2019s high stakes extend far beyond FTX, with one headline describing it as \u201ccrypto\u2019s colonoscopy.\u201d) And earlier this week, Binance \u2014 the world\u2019s largest top crypto exchange \u2014 stopped taking new customers after regulators blocked it from marketing to British consumers. When asked about the timing, Gupta said the FTX trial \u201cis not a reflection of crypto\u201d but rather a \u201cfunction on different levels of fraud and individual greed.\u201d Gupta argues it\u2019s \u201cthe time to bring the focus back on what this incredible revolution really is, how it impacts people\u2019s lives, both today but even more so in the future.\u201d \u201cWe are not naive in thinking crypto is perfect,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn fact, none of the innovations that have happened that we use today in our daily lives were perfect in the first many years.\u201d There are also other problems that have played a role in eroding trust include \u201cuntrustworthy influencers\u201d and countless crypto-related Twitter bots, said Jack Cameron, co-founder of the Web3 agency Insomnia Labs. \u201cThe consumer has to be smarter about how they\u2019re impressed upon,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cEspecially with platforms like X where we know bots have existed and will continue to exist.\u201d Scams, scandals and bots have all tarnished trust in crypto, said Anas Al Fattal, a marketing professor at the University of Minnesota Crookston. \u201cSadly, bad news travels fast,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd with one example of FTX, people start making stories and saying \u2018Did you see what happened to cryptocurrency?\u2019\u201d While researching consumer mindsets about crypto, Al Fattal \u2014 who is now writing a book about trust and crypto \u2014 found new investors are more influenced by social factors including social media, influencers, TV ads and the thoughts of family and friends. On the other hand, experienced investors spend a lot of time researching crypto projects and are most influenced by crypto developers. \u201cPromotion is what the business can control,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you look at the other side, the users themselves or the consumers, they are more powerful in promoting a platform and creating trust for it. But how can you get more users to trust you?\u201d At Kraken, Gupta hopes he has an answer to that.

As well as how much does it cost to drive app installs via Facebook, TikTok, Google Ads and more. If you aren\u2019t familiar with CPI advertising or CPI marketing term, let\u2019s us explain. A mobile app advertising campaign can be built around a number of different models, each implies charging the app marketer when a particular action is taken. If the entire advertising campaign is based around charging per an app install, another words it\u2019s CPI-based, marketers refer to it as CPI marketing. - Advertisement -Picture This: Fully-Optimized CPI, User Acquisition at ScaleYou may be asking, how can I optimize my app\u2019s user acquisition potential? We have a mobile expert team with a playbook of best practices to answer that. Learn more First things first, let\u2019s start with providing the set of stats that draw the picture for Cost Per Install for apps in general, mobile app games and ad platform specific. Key Average Cost Per Install Statistics: iOS CPI globally \u2013 $1.5 to $3.5 Android CPI globally (Google Play market) \u2013 $1.5 to $4.00 Mobile app CPI, by location: APAC \u2013 $1.5 to $3.00 EMEA \u2013 $2.00 \u2013 $4.00 Latin America \u2013 $0.50 \u2013 $2.00 North America \u2013 $2.5 to $5.00 iOS Games CPI \u2013 $2 \u2013 $5 Android Games CPI \u2013 $1.5 to $4.00 Facebook Ads CPI \u2013 $1.00 to $3.00 TikTok Ads CPI \u2013 $0.50 to $2.50 Google Ads CPI \u2013 $0.50 to $2.50 Ad Networks CPI \u2013 $1.75 to $4.5 Before diving into the specifics, it will certainly make sense to give a definition for what is Cost Per Install and how to calculate it. User Acquisition Buyer's GuideDownload our User Acquisition Buyer\u2019s Guide to get a full list of the best service providers on the market to choose from. The guide also covers what is a user acquisition company and how to choose the right one. Cost per install (aka CPI) \u2013 a definition and formula The most concise definition is: \u201cCPI (Cost Per Install) \u2013 the amount of money spent to generate one install of a mobile app.\u201d The formula for calculating Cost Per Install is quite simple, in fact, it\u2019s implied in the name: Your total ad spends divided by a number of installs. Now we\u2019ve set our terms, let\u2019s have a look at what a Cost Per Install campaign is and why it is important. What is a CPI campaign and why is it important? Cost Per Install is one of the many metrics by which app marketers measure spending of their mobile app marketing budget. The advertiser only pays the online ad platform or ad network once the app is installed, instead of just the advert being viewed (known as the CPM, or Cost Per Mille, model). This puts the onus on ad networks to place the advert in mobile apps and websites where conversion rates are high and to target the ad appropriately to the correct audience. This is a direct incentive for ad networks to optimize mobile app install campaigns as efficient as possible. Given the higher value behind an app install over a simple viewing of the advert, costs per install are also significantly higher \u2013 in some places around $5, whereas CPM can vary wildly from $0.78 to $7.00 depending on the platform (iOS/Android) and the advert format (interstitials, banners etc). Why is CPI a valid metric? Back in May 2016 Fiksu (now BidMind), a major mobile marketing company, stopped featuring CPI statistics in their core set of Index reports. According to the company, \u201calthough it still has a role, CPI should no longer be the central metric to measure app marketing success.\u201d The reasoning behind was that the increasing number of reports demonstrated that the \u201capp craze\u201d was waning. People downloaded fewer apps than before, and open even fewer; as such, a \u201cmere\u201d app install was no longer a good metric of whether your app was successful. This, coupled with the fact that the most successful apps are free to download and monetize via in-app transactions or eCommerce, also puts paid to this theory. That being said, CPI is still more important than CPM if what you\u2019re advertising is the app itself, and not an eCommerce product. It\u2019s still a great metric for games, especially if you set the pay-out to trigger upon a certain achievement in the game which is far more indicative of user engagement than just downloading. CPI providers have wisened up to the \u201cend of the app craze\u201d and there are plenty of ways of making the metric significant and of making CPI campaigns successful. Other metrics which you should consider alongside CPI are Cost Per Loyal User/Cost Per Engagement (the line between the definition of these two is becoming increasingly blurred) and Cost Per Sale (only triggers when a sale is made). Hands down the biggest driver behind growth of the mobile app ecosystem are games and so let\u2019s take a close look at how much it takes to generate a mobile app game install on major mobile platforms and for different types of games. Cost Per Install iOS vs. Android games, by category To that end, let\u2019s put together the data to compare Cost-Per-Install for iOS and Android games, stacking data points for Casual, Mid-Core, Hardcore, Puzzle, Strategy, Action, RPG, Sports, Simulation, and Arcade games. The difference between an average iOS CPI for Casual games and Android is significant and iOS is the winner in this competition, it\u2019s $1.5 for Android versus $2.5 for iOS. This gap can be attributed to a higher lifetime value of iOS users, since historically iPhone owners tend to spend more on mobile apps, as well as on any Apple products or services in general. This higher value invites advertisers to spend more money to acquire these app users and it drives the CPI up. Indeed, it costs on average $4.5 to generate a single iOS Mid-Core game install compared with $3.25 for its Android counterpart. A Hardcore game install costs $6 for iOS and only $4.5 for Android, $3 for Puzzle games for iOS versus $2 for Android, $5.5 for iOS for Strategy game players vs. $4 on the Android side of the equation. In fact, this trend, higher iOS than Android CPI, can be been seen across all game categories. Average Cost Per Install (CPI) of mobile games worldwide, by genre and platform Source: AppsFlyer, Adjust, Sensor Tower From cost per install for mobile games to how much it costs to acquire app users via paid ad platforms from all major social media platforms. Facebook Ads Cost Per Install On the current digital marketing landscape, one of the major sources to find new users for an app is social media. By now, all major social media companies provide paid advertising solutions, such as: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads, Reddit Ads, Pinterest Ads, X Ads (former Twitter Ads) that allow app marketers to acquire installs for their apps. All of these platforms leverage data they accumulate on their users to identify people\u2019s preferences, likes and habits to supply app marketers with valuable information for effective targeting. We\u2019re going to begin with the Facebook Ads platform as one of the oldest and, to this day, most efficient ones that help app developers and brands reach out specific app user segments across the world. As you can see on the graph below, CPI for Facebook Ads has been steadily growing over the years and there are several factors that influence this growth such as privacy regulations, market competition, ad quality and relevance, economic factors, and more. Privacy regulations wise two major contributors should be named \u2013 GDPR law that was introduced in 2018 and forced European app developers, as well as developers outside of Europe as well because the Internet has no real boarders, to change their app users data policy. The Apple\u2019s ATT framework, introduced by Apple in 2021, is another privacy regulation, this time introduced not by government but a private corporation, changed the landscape of CPI rates even more. Naturally, as time goes by the number of apps that compete for app users\u2019 attention and wallets grows and it drives CPI up. Last, but by any means, not least factor was COVID-19 that reshaped the app industry and significantly impacted pricing of acquiring app users via Facebook Ads. In 2019 it cost anywhere between $1 and $3 dollars to acquire a single install via the Facebook paid ad platform, by 2023 this range doubled with $2 minimum and as high as $5 maximum to generate a single app install. For this year it\u2019s projected that the minimal Facebook Ads CPI will stay $2 but the maximum will jump to $5.5. Facebook Ads Cost per install 2019-2024, $ Sources: AppsFlyer, Adjust, Sensor Tower For a number of years the paid mobile user acquisition landscape was divided between Facebook Ads and Google Ads but then TikTok Ads came along and it changed everything. Let\u2019s switch to this status quo challenger and CPI rates app developers and brands should expect for running UA campaigns on it. TikTok Ads Cost Per Install As another big player on the market of digital paid advertising, TikTok Ads platform has been influenced by the same factors as Facebook Ads \u2013 privacy regulations, economic factors, ad quality and relevance, as well as some different ones, let\u2019s focus on these. First up is ad innovation \u2013 TikTok brought to the video sharing platforms space, previously dominated by YouTube and Instagram, entirely new style of shooting video clips. This style set the tone for what ads are being run on the platform and pricing generating app installs via this new video ad style. The other factor, that is impossible to miss, is a looming threat of being banned in the US that ultimately manifested as a brand new law that forces Bytedance, the company owner, to sell it to a US company or being banned within a year. In 2020 TikTok Ads Cost Per Install took a modest start with a minimal rate of $0.75 per install to $2 maximum, by 2023 this rate doubled for the minimal value to $1.5 and almost doubled for the upper limit \u2013 $3.5 per install. For 2024 it\u2019s projected that a single app install via TikTok Ads will cost between $1.75 and $4 per install. TikTok Ads Cost per install 2020-2024, $ Sources: AppsFlyer, Adjust, Singular Now let\u2019s jump back to a paid adverting platform to drive mobile app installs that shared the digital advertising duopoly before the rise of TikTok \u2013 Google Ads. Google Ads Cost Per Install Turning to paid ad platform to acquire mobile app users from Google, we see the biggest delta between minimal and maximum price for a mobile app install marketers pay on Google Ads. On top of all previously mentioned factors that influence fluctuations of CPI rates, for this platform specifically we need to mention automation that Google brought to its Google App Campaigns solution back in 2019 and it meant to maximize UA campaigns efficiency without any advertisers\u2019 intervention. Essentially it was plugging AI to running the platform to take care of on-the-fly non-stop changes to campaigns bidding, ad creatives tweaking, essentially all settings of the ad campaign. This is how Google aims to help app marketers to leverage its huge audiences across Search, Google Play, YouTube, Discover on Google Search, and the Google Display Network. Having said all this, here is how Google Ads CPI has been changing over the years. In 2019 app marketers could generate a mobile app install for a price ranging from 50 cents to $2. By 2023 running UA campaigns on Google Ads, app marketers paid from $1.5 to $4 per install, for this year a prediction calls for as the same $1.5 minimum and up to $4.5 per a single app install. There is one change, that Google has been rolling out gradually in 2024, which is its Search Generative Experience \u2013 Generative AI-based tech to answer queries comprehensively right on a search results page, which is yet to influence both native and paid traffic from Google and it certainly has a potential to change Cost Per Install for Google Ads. Google Ads Cost per install 2019-2024, $ Now, when we\u2019ve reviewed CPI rates for all major paid ad platforms from the biggest players on a market \u2013 Facebook, TikTok and Google Ads, let\u2019s turn to the Cost Per Install rates for major mobile advertising networks that aren\u2019t affiliated with any social network, video sharing platform or a search engine. As of this writing, these ad networks are Unity, Applovin, ironSource and Vungle. Ad Networks Cost Per Install For the last five years all ad networks CPI rates we review in this section have been influenced by the same common factors \u2013 market competition, targeting capabilities, ad quality and format, user demographics, app category, seasonal trends, network performance metrics, tech advancements and economic ones. With the exception of 2020 and partially 2021, when COVID-19, obviously, had a major impact on the entire economy and hence influenced Cost Per Install rates ad networks had in those years. Above all other factors, advertiser demand and ad inventory supply have been setting the tone for ad networks CPI rates to go up or down. The more advertisers join the platform, the higher is competition and hence the higher rates. Limited availability of premium ad inventory has also contributed to how low or high Cost Per Install were for a particular ad network. Another big contributors are conversion rates and engagement metrics. With these two things are pretty straightforward \u2013 the higher conversion rate the lower CPI, because app marketers manage to acquire app users more efficiently and it lowers the rates. Finally, introduction of Machine Learning and AI into the technological stack of these ad networks allowed to provide better targeting and effectively lower CPI rates. The rise of programmatic advertising allowed for more efficient and automated ad buying, impacting CPIs based on the effectiveness of the bidding algorithms. With all in mind, let\u2019s take a look at specific numbers for the rates from 2019 to 2023 and a projection for 2024. As of 2019, on average it took anywhere in between $0.50 / install either on iOS or Android to $2.00, in 2020 these figures raised to $0.75 and $2.5 respectively. From 2021 to 2023 each year brought additional $0.50 for both minimum and maximum CPI rates. For this year, 2024, the projection is that it will be costing app marketers to generate a single app install between $1.75 and $4.5. Ad Networks CPI rates for mobile apps over time, $ Sources: AppsFlyer, Adjust, Singular The next logical question, after building a comprehensive picture of major paid ad platforms and ad networks, is how to choose the right CPI network or platform for your mobile app user acquisition campaign. How to choose a CPI network / platform There is a number of things you should look at when choosing your CPI campaign provider. A well-targeted CPI campaign will often be successful, but the devil is in the detail, so these are the things to look out for. Target audience alignment The right targeting of your user acquisition campaign is a number one priority \u2013 it\u2019s just obvious that you need to communicate to people who are potentially interested in your app. Hence user demographics and geographic reach are two things you need to check a specific network or platform you\u2019re considering to use for your UA needs. With the right demographics you make sure you\u2019ll be approaching people of a gender, age, location and interests you need and for the right geographic reach you need to pick up a network / platform that has a strong presence in that particular region. Ad formats and creative options The general rule of a thumb is that you need to find ad networks and platforms that offer a variety of ad formats and is flexible with A/B testing so you can find the right combination of text, image and video creatives to deliver the most engaging messages to your audience. Platform reach and inventory To being able to grow your mobile app user base continuously over time you need an ad network that will provide big enough user base. Another important consideration is to make sure that platform or an ad network can actually provide inventory with premium and relevant contexts to make your ads content relevant. Targeting capabilities Ideally to aim for ad networks or platforms that provide the best in class targeting capabilities, the more granular they are, the more types of information they utilize to target your ads the better. Performance tracking and analytics Real-time analytics and reliable attribution tools are must in your app marketing campaign toolbox. Both will inform your ad campaign and help you to make right choices about what ad channels to use and what to change in your app. Cost and pricing models Of course specific ad network or platform Cost Per Install will be one of the factors to allow you to choose the right partner. Budgeting options are also something you need to look after to being able to set daily cups and lifetime budgets. Fraud prevention This list of things to consider wouldn\u2019t be complete without factoring in fraud prevention. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a well-known fact that a significant portion of digital advertising budgets are spent on fraudulent traffic. Make sure you check what specific measures and tools are in place to counteract fraud on a platform or ad network you evaluate. Compliance and Privacy Ensure the network or platform complies with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and has robust data protection practices. Evaluate how the network handles user data and privacy concerns, particularly in light of increasing regulatory scrutiny. Final Thoughts As of today CPI metric has definitely lost its initial appeal to mobile app marketers but it is still a part of the app marketing efforts equation. With CPI campaigns app marketers may achieve several goals. Such as growing the number of users their apps have, boosting an app\u2019s ranking on the App Store / Google Play market to secure it higher visibility, increase the number of users for their apps, while App Store Optimization they\u2019ve been applying, hasn\u2019t impacted their native user acquisition yet and more. The most popular social networks provide highly effective advertising platforms for mobile app marketers to leverage their extensive user profile data sets. As a metric Cost Per Install should always be measured and optimized in conjunction with the Cost Per Action model that measures app marketers\u2019 expenses to achieve specific actions for their apps \u2013 in-app purchase, registration, subscription, and more.",

Along with the temperature and time, the sign at first showed words from a now-famous white paper written by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym for the creator of bitcoin. Later, it started displaying jokes like: \u201cWhat does a Thanksgiving turkey say? HODL HODL HODL.\u201d (HODL is a popular crypto acronym for \u201cHold On for Dear Life.\u201d) Turned out it was all part of an ad for Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. The company bought a three-year lease for the billboard, but it\u2019s been buying out-of-home ads for years in various markets since 2019, when it ran a bus campaign in Los Angeles promising: \u201cCrypto without chaos.\u201d \u201cOur philosophy with out-of-home is you\u2019re never going to explain the world of crypto with OOH,\u201d said Jonathan Isaac, Gemini\u2019s global head of brand and marketing. But he said you can still introduce a brand to the world and sell products, making it a \u201cfantastically powerful medium for the crypto-curious\u201d and even \u201curban theater.\u201d Earlier this year, Gemini used OOH advertising again to market a new credit card that rewarded users with crypto while collaborating with NFT artists for a broader campaign called \u201cWhat\u2019s The Best That Could Happen?\u201d THE VALUE OF OOH Market to mainstream audiences; Build trust and awareness; Legitimize new categories of products and services; Explain complex concepts (like crypto); Utilize \u201curban theater.\u201d Gemini is one of many cryptocurrency companies that have been buying out-of-home advertising in cities across the U.S. and Europe to increasingly market to mainstream audiences. High with hype, top crypto companies are looking to reach the masses with the same tricks used before by a wave of DTC brands that used billboards and subway ads to legitimize new categories of products and services. Unlike mattresses and toothbrushes, the crypto category isn\u2019t something as easily understood. It\u2019s also not always as easy to differentiate one crypto brand from the next, or what\u2019s really worth betting real money on buying. There\u2019s also the question of whether the so-called \u201ccrypto winter\u201d will cause companies to slow ad spend as the crypto industry faces layoffs, crashes, regulation and more speculation. But so far, marketers say they don\u2019t plan on making changes to their budgets and that ads across billboards and elsewhere help to explain complex concepts in a crowded category. So far, the majority of campaigns have been showing up in tech-saturated markets like New York, Seattle, Los Angeles, Austin and Nashville, according to out-of-home advertising vendors, and costing anywhere from $35,000 to $300,000 for between less than a week to four weeks. Others say crypto companies have paid in the \u201cmultimillions\u201d for high-traffic intersections and long-term deals. Other ad buys during events like Art Basel have cost closer to six digits. \u201cIt\u2019s heavy and acute,\u201d said James Heller, founder of Wrapify, which has helped several crypto companies advertise on cars. \u201cThe sales cycle for it is, \u2018Hey we have $1 million and we need to spend it.\u2019\u201d Appeal to the masses Until recently, crypto brands were mostly preaching to the converted. However, in the past year, the need to go mainstream has led top companies to pay top dollars for everything from stadiums and jersey rights to Super Bowl ads and celebrity endorsements. And while billboards might seem too static for a digitally-native industry like crypto, some say it\u2019s a way to build trust and awareness in a category fraught with skepticism. Meanwhile, layoffs and hiring freezes at top crypto companies like Coinbase and Gemini have some predicting strong headwinds ahead not long after previously obscure brands have gained mainstream recognition. Last year, Grayscale and Gemini were among the top five crypto companies spending on out-of-home ads, according to OneScreen.AI, a startup that tracks outdoor ad inventory. The company\u2019s analysis of Kantar data found that both spent around $4 million between January 2021 and February 2022, followed by KOK at $2.75 million, Crypto.com at $1 million and Etherlite at less than $500,000. \u201cOut-of-home media tends to favor brands that nobody knows about,\u201d said Sam Mallikarjunan, CEO and co-founder of OneScreen.AI. Out-of-home media tends to favor brands that nobody knows about. Sam Mallikarjunan, CEO and co-founder, OneScreen.AI Outdoor ads have moved to smaller markets, too. Earlier this year, OneScreen.AI\u2019s analysis found Gemini spent 45% of its OOH budget on New York, 20% in Los Angeles, 13% in Miami \u2014 a city that\u2019s become increasingly associated with cryptocurrency \u2014 followed by smaller percentages in San Francisco, Chicago and Dallas. Meanwhile, Grayscale\u2019s also bought OOH ads in markets like Atlanta and Denver, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in each city. Crypto billboards are showing up everywhere from subway stations and highways to boats, buses and airport lounges. It\u2019s \u201csome of the craziest, most competitive things I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Mallikarjunan said, adding that some crypto brands he\u2019s spoken with have wanted to \u201cout-bid\u201d and \u201cout-buy\u201d competitors. (He said one crypto company wanted to even buy the little league jerseys of a team whose coach works for a competitor.) Because blockchain technology is still relatively new, it doesn\u2019t always make sense to appeal to the masses, said Algorand head of marketing Keli Callaghan. Instead, OOH advertising \u201cbecomes super critical\u201d when you have something specific going on in a certain city or region.For Earth Day 2020 in April, Algorand did a billboard buyout to tout the company\u2019s energy efficiency. By going dark for an hour, the company said Times Square saved as much energy as 350 million transactions of the Algorand blockchain. (Algorand also did a separate OOH campaign in April in Miami during Miami Tech Month on digital billboards next to the city\u2019s Citibike stations.) Crypto is still \u201cin this crossing the chasm moment,\u201d which requires ways of using the familiar to market the unfamiliar, said Andrew Tam, chief marketing officer of the crypto-lending platform BlockFi. To debut its credit card last year, BlockFi used out-of-home ads to show how people can use something familiar\u2014a credit card\u2014to earn and own cryptocurrency. (Tam wouldn\u2019t disclose exactly how much BlockFi has spent on OOH ads, but said the company has spent at least seven figures for its campaigns.) \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of early adopters and a lot of evangelists,\u201d Tam said. \u201cGetting across that chasm into mainstream adoption requires products like the credit card \u2026 Part of the thinking for us was to try and play that mass appeal product via some more traditional advertising mediums.\u201d Using OOH for more than brand awareness After using digital ads with brand awareness messaging in early 2021 to welcome travelers back to airports, the digital currency asset manager GrayScale Investments is now using targeted campaigns as part of its lobbying efforts. As Grayscale waits on U.S. regulators to approve its proposed bitcoin ETF, the company has rolled out outdoor ad campaigns in New York City at bus links and airport lounges which urge people to write letters to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected to make a decision on the fund by early July. (So far, the company says it\u2019s collected 11,000 letters.) Seres Lu, VP of marketing at GrayScale, says the company has opted for digital OOH ads because it allows them to switch out creative and messaging at the same speed as the industry changes. It also lets them buy billboards for shorter periods of time compared to classic static placements. \u201cWe can\u2019t assume that people will scan a QR code or put in a URL,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we can\u2019t ensure they will lead to more information and more disclosures, which means what we put on that billboard needs to be really really thoughtful and also short and catchy.\u201d Around the world, countries are cracking down on crypto billboards. British regulators have called for banning crypto ads in transit stations and buses, calling for rules similar to what\u2019s already in place for junk food advertising. In March, 50 companies were sent notices to review their ads to make sure they comply with all rules. (Since 2018, crypto companies have spent around $1 million on ads across London\u2019s transportation system, according to The Guardian, with 13 companies running 39,000 ads between April and September 2021.) Earlier this year, Spanish regulators introduced a new law that requires companies to disclose plans for a campaign at least 10 days before it runs\u2014a set of rules that also applies to crypto-pitching influencers that have more than 100,000 subscribers. And in Singapore, the country\u2019s Monetary Authority already has rules for promoting crypto or other digital payment tokens, warning they are \u201chighly risky and not suitable for the general public.\u201d Beyond billboards, crypto brands also continue to advertise elsewhere. According to BlueOcean\u2014a startup that analyzes how brands market themselves across various platforms and how they\u2019re perceived by customers\u2014the highest spenders in the crypto over the past month across TV, print and OOH have been FTX, Coinbase and eToro. Others have pulled back on paid media, including paid search. \u201cSometimes it doesn\u2019t pay to be first or biggest out of the gate,\u201d said Liza Nebel, BlueOcean\u2019s cofounder. \u201cThe customer will speak and that will drive the market. It\u2019s less about the megaphone and more about the dialogue.\u201d Share Copy \u00d7 Share this article Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Trending in Brands in Culture 01 Brands in Culture Behind Pacsun\u2019s strategy for keeping a pulse on the changing tastes of Gen Z 02 Brands in Culture \u2018Amplified, and used against you\u2019: Nike sat out the viral Maduro moment.

      "content": "Tuesday, June 10th, 2025 \u2013 9:00 am SHARE: Expect to see more AI-generated ads on the Amazon website going forward. On Tuesday, Amazon announced the US release of its AI-powered video generator tool after nine months of beta testing. It also rolled out an updated version of the image generator first announced in 2023. The video generator, which is now free to use for users with an authenticated Amazon seller account, allows for the creation of eight-second video ads (which the company describes as \u201clow-motion,\u201d presumably meaning that not much is actually moving in frame) from existing product images. The tool can also take existing video assets, identify and summarize key clips and generate new videos from them for ad campaigns. The AI models are trained on a variety of open, freely available data sources, including product information from Amazon Ads accounts. Doing more with less Most of the retailers who work with Amazon Ads lack the budget and expertise of professional marketers, Jay Richman, Amazon\u2019s VP of product and technology, told AdExchanger. Although some larger retail brands have embraced Amazon\u2019s image and video generation tools, the main intention, Richman said, is to serve the needs of smaller, independently run businesses. There\u2019s been good adoption so far. According to Amazon Ads, 50% of the products promoted with AI-generated video assets are being advertised for the very first time, suggesting that these companies would not have previously been able to make these kinds of ads on their own. Amazon wasn\u2019t able to share whether AI-generated video ads contribute to higher sales for the businesses that use them. Richman did note, however, that sponsored brand campaigns featuring video elements see a 30% higher clickthrough rate on average. \u2018Beyond white backgrounds\u2019 Subscribe AdExchanger Daily Get our editors\u2019 roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. Daily Roundup Daily News Roundup Cadent Gets Direct; Curating YouTube, Netflix-Style The trend toward more video ads on Amazon has also given the company a larger catalogue of product pages and assets to train their generative AI tools on, allowing the technology to advance rapidly over the last few years. When the original image generator was first launched 18 months ago, it was most useful for standalone products like chairs or appliances, but less so for products that \u201ccould not be easily placed on a flat surface,\u201d Richman said. For example, the previous generation of the tool had a hard time taking a photo of a wristwatch and making it look natural against an AI-generated backdrop. But now it can place the watch somewhere more intuitive, such as on the wrist of a photorealistic figure resembling a human model. Similarly, the new video generator cana produce short animated scenes, meaning that same human figure can now adjust the watch on its wrist or the camera can zoom in on the watch as the figure drives a car. Once these scenes are cut together and overlaid with written copy, which is separately generated by an LLM, the final result looks not unlike a professional (albeit slightly generic) video ad. Advertisers can also use the tool to modify the copy, add and adjust the placement of logos and edit the length and order of AI-generated clips. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to recreate a full creative suite,\u201d said Richman. \u201cWe want our customers who are not professional marketers to be able to get in and out and onto their day job, but to do so in a way that elevates their brand beyond white backgrounds.\u201d Product shown not actual size Of course, anybody who\u2019s accidentally bought a dud or a dupe on Amazon will have a natural follow-up question: What kind of guardrails does the company have to ensure these AI generation tools aren\u2019t used to advertise fake items? To that, Richman said the AI-generated ads go through the same moderation process as everything else on Amazon\u2019s site. (Unfortunately, though, as both The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post reported in 2019, Amazon\u2019s automated moderation of third-party sellers frequently misses counterfeit and banned products.) And there are also other limitations to the technology, at least for now. For instance, while the tool is more than capable of producing short, montage-style clips featuring the same or similar-looking human figures, it\u2019s less adept at longer-form narratives. However, Richman said he\u2019s excited by how far the technology has already come in the last two years, and pointed out that this is a real product launch and far from the sort of \u201cfantastical prototypes\u201d that some AI companies rely on in their marketing pushes. \u201cThis is like a real, practical application of generative AI that is live today and is ready to scale,\u201d said Richman.

      "content": "SHAPING WHAT\u2019S NEXT IN MEDIA Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 SECURE YOUR SEAT Generative AI AI Briefing: How AI misinformation affects consumer thoughts on elections and brands By Marty Swant \u2022 April 22, 2024 \u2022 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Ivy Liu For nearly a decade, brand safety has been the ad world\u2019s white whale \u2014 constantly evading the harpoon of those looking to steer clear of dangerous or salacious content. But the proliferation of generative AI has conjured up an even scarier kind of monster: a multi-headed hydra. The fight is already on. To boost its efforts around brand safety, IPG Mediabrands is adding more tools for identifying harmful content while also helping advertisers avoid appearing near it. One way is through an expanded partnership with Zefr, a brand-safety startup that tracks content across Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. Along with new ways to pre-block high-risk social content, the companies are creating custom dashboards to help advertisers avoid user-generated content in sensitive categories across text, images, video and audio. Sensitive categories include AI-generated content and misinformation related to U.S. politics, climate denialism, health care and brand-specific content. \u201cWe already have a lot of tools in the programmatic space to help manage misinformation, manage brand safety [and] suitability, but there has always been a void when it comes to UGC in walled gardens,\u201d said Ruowen Liscio, vice president of global commerce and innovation partnerships at Kinesso. By targeting harmful content, the companies hope to not just help advertisers but also cut off ad funding for such content. According to Zefr chief commercial officer Andrew Serby, misinformation-related content from AI and other sources stays on platforms because it\u2019s funded by ad dollars. But combatting that funding first requires identifying the misinformation and its sources at scale. To understand consumer perceptions about misinformation \u2014 and the ads that appear by it \u2014 IPG\u2019s Magna conducted research about how people viewed harmful content and how it affected their perceptions about brands and platforms. Only 36% of respondents to a survey featured in the research thought it was appropriate for brands to appear next to AI-generated content. Ads that appeared next to misinformation were also seen as less trustworthy, and brand perception was hurt even when people weren\u2019t sure if content was real or not. Although political content was easiest for survey participants to identify, only 44% correctly identified the fake political content, 15% were incorrect and the rest were unsure. AI-generated content \u2014 including images of U.S. presidents playing Pok\u00e9mon and Pope Francis wearing Balenciaga \u2014 fooled 23% of respondents and left 41% unsure. Meanwhile, 33% of respondents incorrectly identified misinformation about climate change and 25% were wrong about healthcare-related misinformation. \u201cWhat was most important for us that came out of the research is just the ability to understand the quantified impact of what happens when brands appear next to misinformation,\u201d said Kara Manatt, evp of intelligence solutions at Magna. Companies in the business of AI-generated content are also researching consumer sentiment. In a new report from Adobe, 80% of U.S. adults think misinformation and harmful deepfakes will impact upcoming elections. According to the survey, 78% of respondents thought election candidates shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use AI-generated content in campaigns, while 83% think the government and tech companies should work together to address problems with AI-generated misinformation. The survey results, released last week, include answers from 6,000 people in the U.S. and several European countries. The findings come amidst debates about whether tech companies should be liable for information on their platforms. The U.S. Supreme Court is also considering a legal battles online content including whether government officials should be allowed communicate with tech companies about disinformation on various platforms. Meanwhile, Rest Of The World, a global media nonprofit, also published a new website for tracking election-related AI content across major platforms in nearly a dozen countries. Concerns exist across numerous online platforms including X. Even as DoubleVerify claimed the platform formerly known as Twitter was 99% brand-safe, a report from ISD found examples of dozens of AI-generated misinformation images that were posted by verified accounts hours after Iran\u2019s drone strike on Israel and viewed 37 million times within hours. Adobe\u2019s report helps illustrate the importance of people and companies having tools to identify what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not. Misinformation fueled by generative AI is \u201cone of the most critical threats facing us as a society,\u201d said Andy Parsons, senior director of the Content Authenticity Initiative at Adobe. In an interview last week, Parsons told Digiday that it\u2019s important that people continue to trust verified news sources and don\u2019t begin to question everything when the lines between truth and fiction become too blurred. \u201cThere\u2019s this liar\u2019s dividend, which is once you can question anything and nothing can actually be believed to be true,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cThen how do you even verify that news is news or that you\u2019re not seeing somebody else\u2019s worldview? Or that you\u2019re not being duped with even social media content [even if] it\u2019s from a news source. And then what is the news source if you can\u2019t believe anything you see because it may have been manipulated?\u201d In other words, there are as many questions as the hydra has heads \u2014 if not more. Prompts and Products: Other AI news last week: Along with debuting its Llama 3 model, Meta rolled out several enhancements for its Meta AI chatbot across apps including Facebook, Instagram and a new website for the ChatGPT rival.

Snap announced it will start watermarking AI content and updated other parts of its safety/transparency policy. Google announced new generative AI image tools for demand-gen campaigns.

      "content": "Thursday, May 15th, 2025 \u2013 12:03 am SHARE: No Fix For Brokers Earlier this week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) abandoned plans to introduce a new rule limiting a data broker\u2019s ability to sell the sensitive information of Americans, Wired reports. The proposed rule would have allowed regulators to police financial data brokers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), one of the nation\u2019s oldest privacy laws. Third-party data brokers would have been barred from selling credit scores, Social Security numbers, phone numbers and addresses. Credit reporting agencies are already restricted from such activities under the FCRA. The rule change was proposed in December under former CFPB chair Rohit Chopra. However, Chopra was replaced in February by Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, who was appointed as acting CFPB director by President Trump. The Financial Technology Association, a trade organization for fin tech companies, sent a letter to Vought on Monday claiming the proposed rule overstepped the CFPB\u2019s authority and would be \u201charmful to financial institutions\u2019 efforts to detect and prevent fraud.\u201d Vought squashed the rule change the following day, writing in a still-unpublished notice that the proposal did not align with the CFPB\u2019s \u201ccurrent interpretation of the FCRA.\u201d AI\u2019s True Lies Social media is all in on AI-generated content, despite mounting evidence that deepfakes and AI slop are taking over these platforms and influencing users. Even Academy Award winners aren\u2019t protected from AI-fueled scams. Actress Jamie Lee Curtis went viral this week for fighting back against an AI deepfake ad featuring her likeness that has been running on Instagram for months, the LA Times reports. The ad repurposed footage from a recent interview with Curtis and manipulated her voice to make it seem as though she was endorsing a dental product. Curtis tells the LA Times that her management and legal teams first contacted Meta about removing the ad a month and a half ago \u2013 and received no response. So Curtis took to Instagram on Monday and called out Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a viral post. The fake ad was removed the same day, Meta confirmed to the LA Times. But Curtis worries about the lack of official options for fighting back against AI deepfakes. \u201cI understand there\u2019s going to be a misuse of this stuff, but then there\u2019s no avenue of getting any satisfaction,\u201d she tells the LA Times. \u201cSo then it\u2019s lawlessness.\u201d Gas-ual Dining Move over, CTV and digital ads, and make way for \u2026 gas pumps? Well, sort of. Chain restaurant Applebee\u2019s wasn\u2019t seeing enough of a bump from CTV and online ads on their own, but when paired with GSTV \u2013 which stands for Gas Station TV \u2013 there was a 22% and 27% increase in visits, respectively. GSTV has an 80% success rate at improving foot traffic for restaurant advertisers, Eric Sherman, GSTV\u2019s EVP of insights and analytics told Adweek. Sherman describes these on-the-go ads as \u201cNewtonian Advertising,\u201d riffing on Newton\u2019s first law of motion: People who are out and about are more likely to remain out. GSTV is also reaching audiences who hadn\u2019t seen Applebee\u2019s ads elsewhere, expanding their reach and increasing brand awareness. These gas pump video ads alone increased foot traffic by 12%. A parting thought: Gas might be bringing people to Applebee\u2019s, but let\u2019s just hope that, in return, Applebee\u2019s isn\u2019t giving people gas. But Wait!

      "content": "SHAPING WHAT\u2019S NEXT IN MEDIA Last chance to save on Digiday Publishing Summit passes is February 9 SECURE YOUR SEAT Beyond Ads AI Briefing: Google Deepmind open-sources SynthID for watermarking generated text By Marty Swant \u2022 October 28, 2024 \u2022 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Ivy Liu Last week, Google Deepmind expanded the availability of its SynthID tool for watermarking text generated by AI. After implementing SynthID text in Google Gemini earlier this year, it\u2019s making the tool open-source to help improve transparency of AI-generated text from other large language models. Watermarking AI content has been a high priority since AI-generated content began to proliferate over the last two years. While the focus has been largely on watermarking AI images and videos, watermarking text could help detect AI-generated misinformation and scams along with fake product reviews and copyrighted materials. This week\u2019s updates, launching in beta, are part of a broader expansion of SynthID for text, music, images and video, with each content type having a different system for watermarking. \u201cBeing able to identify AI-generated content is critical to promoting trust in information,\u201d read a DeepMind blog post. \u201cWhile not a silver bullet for addressing problems such as misinformation or misattribution, SynthID is a suite of promising technical solutions to this pressing AI safety issue.\u201d In a paper published this week in Nature, the Deepmind research team explained the creation and testing process. When generating text, the AI model embeds an invisible signature using a \u201crandom seed\u201d and a statistical pattern with a score-based system to shape the output text. That process then helps on the other end when detecting whether text was created with generative AI using a secret watermarking key. Researchers also note generative watermarks are perfect and have the limitations when translated, re-written or when used with shorter text and factual content. While some experts have previously warned that watermarking AI content doesn\u2019t go far enough, organizations like C2PA are working to create new standards for AI content transparency and authenticity, with key members like Google and other tech giants. Google also tested SynthID text with a live experiment using nearly 20 million Gemini responses. Along with testing the accuracy of the watermarking process, Google had Gemini users rate text with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down response. Researchers found SynthID text didn\u2019t degrade the quality of outputs or noticeably alter the level of quality or helpfulness of the AI text with SynthID watermarks. The team also conducted a smaller test with 3,000 responses from both watermarked and un-watermarked outputs based on grammar, relevance, accuracy, helpfulness and quality. Marketing and brand safety experts said the approach in general seems like a positive step, but that could depend on the overall efficacy and level of uptake. Various polls have found plenty of consumer interest in transparency for generative AI content, with a survey by SOCi finding 76% of consumers wanting at least some degree of clarity. It\u2019s too soon to know all the ways that SynthID might bring transparency across various LLMs, but it might help detect AI-generated misinformation on social platforms. Damian Rollison, director of market insight at SOCi, said it would be ideal if all AI-generated content \u2014 both helpful and harmful \u2014 could be explicitly identified. \u201cPlatforms where AI content is known to be rampant must actually implement this or similar solutions in a way that is helpful to publishers, advertisers and consumers,\u201d Rollison said. \u201cUnfortunately, platforms like Google itself, Meta, X and others benefit indirectly from the proliferation of AI content, so their will to combat fake content will likely be balanced against a disincentive to impact ad revenues and engagement metrics.\u201d Others agree that scaling will be key, but perhaps not helpful for everything. Nick Sabharwal, vp of product at Seekr, said it might only help with unsophisticated actors. Examples might be teachers checking if a student used Gemini or ChatGPT to write a paper, or consumers checking if a marketing or customer service message was AI-generated. According to Sabharwal, detection tools can be helpful and needed, but are unlikely to prevent harmful content. That\u2019s because malicious actors will move to other platforms that don\u2019t use watermarks. \u201cThere has already been a significant proliferation of LLMs and LLM providers,\u201d Sabharwal said. \u201cConsolidation does not seem likely. Furthermore, nefarious large actors such as nation-states who want to disseminate misinformation can also develop their proprietary models to bypass these guardrails.\u201d If scaling SynthID is successful, could it help prevent online ads from being served on AI-generated websites such as MFAs? Potentially, said Arielle Garcia, director of intelligence at Check My Ads. But unless SynthID provides clarity on its probability scores, there could be similar risks of false flags that already exist with ad verification. Garcia also noted MFAs and other schemes are still largely an incentive issue \u2014 not just a technical problem. \u201cThere still is a lot of money being made from MFA by ad-tech companies, agencies and other vendors paid on volume,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cAnd if brands do not or are not able to confirm where their ads ran, this runs the risk of being another empty/false assurance.\u201d Prompts and Products \u2014 AI news and other announcements More than 25,000 creators have signed a statement about the unlicensed use of creative works for training GenAI that warns of an \u201cunjust threat to the livelihoods of the people behind those works, and must not be permitted.\u201d A lawsuit against Character AI, filed by the mother of a teenager who committed suicided, alleges the role-playing chatbot app contributed to her son\u2019s death. The news has prompted new discussions about the dangers of AI chatbots, especially for younger ages and impressionable users. A new report from Snowflake looks at emerging trends related and unrelated to AI that are shaping the marketing landscape, including the rise of data gravity, generative AI, privacy concerns and commerce media. The AI deepfake detection startup Reality Defender announced additional funding of $15 million in a Series A funding round with new investments from Accenture, IBM Ventures and other sources. (In other news, McAfee and Yahoo News are partnering to verify the authenticity of images and prevent AI misinformation.) OpenAI and Microsoft announced a $10 million deal with numerous publishers including The Minnesota Star Tribune, Philadelphia Inquirer and other major metropolitan newspapers. The European Parliament is using Anthropic\u2019s Claude AI models to create and expand an interactive digital archive. RunwayAI released a new motion-capture tool that lets people use generative AI in videos from their smartphone. The FTC\u2019s new rules banning fake reviews went into effect, which regulate deceptive marketing tactics from both humans and AI. (Read more in our recent explainer.) Anthropic debuted a new AI tool that has the ability to \u201ccontrol\u201d a PC by moving a mouse like a human. Meanwhile, Microsoft plans to start letting companies create their own autonomous AI agents next through its Copilot Studio. Google released new generative AI tools for creating music.

Guess what? It was made with AI. The online marketplace for freelance services has launched a new campaign poking fun at the current hype cycle. It emphasizes AI as a tool rather than a snake oil or a corporate salve. The ad, called \u201cNobody Cares,\u201d launched last week and touts the AI tools increasingly used by freelancers, some of whom are employing various generative AI platforms in projects for a range of clients. \u201cWe see it in our feed, in our LinkedIn feed, and whatever social media you\u2019re on all day: AI. AI. AI,\u201d Fiverr CMO Matti Yahav told Digiday. \u201cOf course, AI is amazing. It\u2019s a fantastic tool. But at the end of the day, the important thing is the result. It\u2019s the impact.\u201d In fact, the commercial itself was created using nearly a dozen generative AI tools, according to Yahav. For images, it used Midjourney, Ideogram, Leonardo, Flux and Photoshop Generative Fill. Animations were made using Runway Gen3, Kling and Minimax. Lipsyncs and Faceswaps also used Runway and Kling along with Liveport. Fiverr is seeing increased interest in AI-powered projects on the platform, Yahav said. While growth varies by domain and industry, he said music and audio are two that have stood out. He thinks the industry should stop talking about whether something is made with AI and instead talk more about the services it powers: \u201cDo you know how much of the service was made with AI? I\u2019m not sure, but it will be like the human talent behind it, consolidating everything, making sure you get the best output.\u201d While AI is boosting productivity for many, concerns about accuracy, quality and legal implications persist. Around 25% of U.S.-based freelancers are worried about privacy, legal and copyright concerns along with 50% of U.K.-based respondents. Fiverr also said it has guardrails to prevent AI misuse on the platform, but Yahav declined to disclose much about what those tactics are. (Instead, a company spokesperson directed Digiday to Fiverr\u2019s community standards page.) Here are some other details from Fiverr\u2019s new report on trends in AI use this year across the platform. The results are based on a survey of 3,300 Fiverr freelancers. Top tools include ChatGPT (used by 88% of respondents), Midjourney (used by 37%), Firefly (29%), Quillbot (18%), Hugging Face (18%) and Gemini (15%). Programming and tech industry use of AI has jumped from 10% in 2023 to 86% in 2024. Music and audio has jumped from 8% in 2023 to 41% this year. Text and content generation is now the most popular type of Fiverr work using AI (40% of respondents use it) while respondents are using it in 19% of visual and arts projects, and it\u2019s used in data analysis 18% of the time. More than a third of freelancers are now paying for AI tool subscriptions, with total paying subscribers to AI tools up 10% over 2023. Two thirds of freelancers say AI helps boost productivity.

See other exclusives or manage your account.This article was provided as an exclusive preview for Digiday+ members, who were able to access it early. Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead With two months left before the U.S. presidential elections, state and federal officials are looking for more ways to address the risks of disinformation from AI and other sources. Last week, the California Assembly approved legislation to improve transparency and accountability with new rules for AI-generated content, including access to detection tools and new disclosure requirements. If signed, the California AI Transparency Act, wouldn\u2019t go into effect until 2026, but it\u2019s the latest in a range of efforts by various states to begin addressing the risks of AI-generated content creation and distribution. \u201cIt is crucial that consumers have the right to know if a product has been generated by AI,\u201d California state senator Josh Becker, the bill\u2019s sponsor, said in a statement. \u201cIn my discussions with experts, it became increasingly clear that the ability to distribute high-quality content made by generative AI creates concerns about its potential misuse. AI-generated images, audio and video could be used for spreading political misinformation and creating deepfakes.\u201d More than a dozen states have now passed laws regulating the use of AI in political ads, with at least a dozen other bills underway in other states. Some, including New York, Florida, and Wisconsin, require political ads to include disclosures if they\u2019re made with AI. Others, such as Minnesota, Arizona and Washington, require AI disclaimers within a certain window before an election. And yet others, including Alabama and Texas, have broader bans on deceptive political messages regardless of whether AI is used. Some states have teams in place to detect and address misinformation from AI and other sources. In Washington state, the secretary of state\u2019s office has a team in place to scan social media for misinformation, according to secretary of state Steve Hobbs. The state is also underway with a major marketing campaign to educate people on how elections work and where to find trustworthy information. In an August interview with Digiday, Hobbs said the campaign will include information about deepfakes and other AI-generated misinformation to help people understand the risks. He said his office is also working with outside partners like the startup Logically to track false narratives and address them before they hit critical mass. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a nation state that has all those resources, it\u2019s going to look convincing, really convincing,\u201d Hobbs said. \u201cDon\u2019t be Putin\u2019s bot. That\u2019s what ends up happening. You get a message, you share it. Guess what? You\u2019re Putin\u2019s bot.\u201d After X\u2019s Grok AI chatbot shared false election information with millions of users, Hobbs and four other secretaries of state sent an open letter to Elon Musk last month asking for immediate changes. They also asked X to have Grok send users to the nonpartisan election information website, CanIVote.org, which is a change OpenAI already made for ChatGPT. AI deepfakes seem to be on the rise globally. Cases in Japan doubled in the first quarter of 2024, according to Nikkei, with scams ranging from text-based phishing emails to social media videos showing doctored broadcast footage. Meanwhile, the British analytics firm Elliptic found examples of politically related AI-generated scams targeting crypto users. New AI tools for IDing deepfakes Cybersecurity firms have also rolled out new tools to help consumers and businesses better detect AI-generated content. One is from Pindrop, which helped detect the AI-generated robocalls resembling President Joe Biden during the New Hampshire primaries. Pindrop\u2019s new Pulse Inspect, released in mid-August, allows users to upload audio to detect whether synthetic audio was used and where in a file it was detected. Early adopters of Pulse Inspect include YouMail, a visual voicemail and Robocall blocking service; TrueMedia, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on fighting AI disinformation; and the AI audio creation platform Respeecher. Other new tools include one from Attestiv, which released a free version last month for consumers and businesses. Another comes from McAfee, which last week announced a partnership with Lenovo to integrate McAfee\u2019s Deepfake Detector tool into Lenovo\u2019s new AI PCs using Microsoft\u2019s Copilot platform. According to McAfee CTO Steve Grobman, the tool helps people analyze video and audio content in real time across most platforms including YouTube, X, Facebook and Instagram. The goal is to give people a tool to \u201chelp a user hear things that might be difficult for them to hear,\u201d Grobman told Digiday, adding that it\u2019s especially important as consumers worry about disinformation during the political season. \u201cIf the video is flagged, we\u2019ll put up one of these little banners, \u2018AI audio detected,\u2019\u201d Grobman said. \u201cAnd if you click on that, you can get some more information. We\u2019ll basically then show a graph of where in the video we started detecting the AI and we\u2019ll show some statistics.\u201d Instead of uploading clips to the cloud, on-device analysis improves speed, user privacy and bandwidth, added Grobman. The software can also be updated as McAfee\u2019s models improve and as AI content evolves to evade detection. McAfee also debuted a new online resource called Smart AI Hub, which aims to educate people about AI misinformation while also collecting examples of crowd-sourced deepfakes. According to McAfee\u2019s consumer survey earlier this year about AI deepfake concerns, 43% of U.S. consumers mentioned the elections, 37% were worried about AI undermining public trust in media, and 56% are worried about AI-facilitated scams. Prompts and Products \u2014 AI news and announcements Google added new generative AI features for advertisers including tools for shopping ads. Meanwhile, the research consultancy Authoritas found Google\u2019s AI Overviews feature already is impacting publisher search visibility. Meta said its Llama AI models have had 10x growth since 2023, with total downloads nearing 350 million and 20 million in just the past month. Examples of companies using Llama include AT&T, Spotify, Niantic, DoorDash and Shopify. Major publishers and platforms are opting out of Apple\u2019s AI scraping efforts, according to Wired. Adobe released a new Workfront feature to help marketers plan campaigns. Yelp filed a new antitrust lawsuit against Google, which claims Google\u2019s using its own AI tools to further give it an advantage. U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan subpoenaed the AI political ad startup Authentic, which happens to employ the daughter of the judge that oversaw Donald Trump\u2019s hush money trial. The startup\u2019s founder criticized Jordan\u2019s move as an \u201cabuse of power\u201d promoting a \u201cbaseless right-wing conspiracy theory.\u201d Apple and Nvidia are reportedly in talks to invest in OpenAI, which is reportedly raising more funding. Nvidia also reported its quarterly earnings last week, with advertising mentioned as one of the industries driving demand. Anthropic published a list of its system prompts for its Claude family of models with the goal of providing more transparency for users and researchers. Q&A with Washington state secretary of state Steve Hobbs In an August interview with Digiday, Washington state secretary of state Steve Hobbs spoke about a new campaign to promote voter trust. He also talked about some of the other efforts underway including how the state is using AI to fight misinformation, why he wants to further regulate AI content, and the importance of voters knowing where to find accurate information to check facts. Here are some excerpts from the conversation. How Washington is using AI to track misinformation \u201cWe\u2019re just informing people about the truth about elections. We also use Logically AI to find threats against election workers. So I\u2019ve had a threat against me. We\u2019ve turned over a potential foreign actor, a nation-state actor that was operating and spreading disinformation. So it\u2019s a tool that we have to have. I know there\u2019s criticism towards it, but my alternative is hiring 100 people to look at the internet or social media, or wait for the narrative to hit critical mass. And by then it\u2019s too late.\u201d On regulating AI platforms and content \u201cSocial media platforms need to be responsible. They need to know where their money\u2019s come from. Who is this person giving me money to run this ad? And is this a deep fake? I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to find out. There\u2019s a responsibility there. They really need to step up to play. I\u2019m hoping the federal government will pass a bill to hold them accountable.\u201d Why voters should verify everything \u201cWhen it comes to social media and the news that you\u2019re getting from social media, pause. Verify who this person is. Is it a bot? Is it a real person and the information that you\u2019re getting is verifiable? Can you see it on other news sources? Is it backed up by other sources? [Americans] are target number one for nation state actors.

      "content": "Thursday, October 2nd, 2025 \u2013 12:35 am SHARE: Richard Eisert Partner Amy Marcus Associate As AI quickly advances and legislators struggle to keep up, it can feel like the Wild West when choosing whether and how to disclose the use of AI in advertising and other communications. However, even though the number and scope of formal mandates under existing U.S. law that require advertisers to disclose the use of AI are limited, there are some restrictions and guidelines that advertisers must follow to ensure their compliance. Most notably, some states have passed\u2014and others are actively considering\u2014legislation governing AI disclosures in certain specific circumstances. Social media platforms, including Meta (Facebook and Instagram), TikTok, YouTube and even Reddit, have also set their own rules surrounding the type of AI advertising content that requires disclosures and how those disclosures must be structured. Limited regulations by the states While there is currently no AI-specific federal regulatory requirement for disclosure in advertising or media, a handful of states have enacted or are attempting to pass limited legislation that is relevant to the AI discussion. California, New Jersey and Utah all require customer service chatbots or similar communication tools fueled by generative artificial intelligence to clearly disclose to users that they are communicating with a bot rather than a real human, especially when a purchase or voting is involved. Moreover, many states have enacted legislation pertaining specifically to the use of AI-generated or manipulated content in political ads. California, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin have all passed laws in the last two years mandating disclosures when the content of political advertisements or other political communications or content includes AI-generated content, including but not limited to the use of deepfakes. Other states also require these types of disclosures, but only within a certain amount of time before an election. Several more states now have proposed and pending legislation that pertains to the use of AI in political ads. Broader proposed state legislation In June 2025, the New York State Legislature became the first to take AI legislation a step further by passing the Synthetic Performer Disclosure Bill, which requires that advertisers make clear and conspicuous disclosures whenever an advertisement includes AI-generated talent, or a \u201csynthetic performer.\u201d The bill is still awaiting Governor Kathy Hochul\u2019s signature. However, the action taken by the New York State Legislature represents a major additional step in the regulatory landscape of AI labeling and disclosure in advertising. Other states, including Georgia, have introduced bills requiring disclosures whenever AI-generated content is used in advertising or commerce. Massachusetts has gone even further with its proposed legislation. The Massachusetts Artificial Intelligence Disclosure Act, introduced in February 2025, would require any generative AI system used to create or modify content within the state to automatically include a clear, conspicuous and permanent disclosure identifying the content as AI-generated.

Daily Roundup Daily News Roundup Cadent Gets Direct; Curating YouTube, Netflix-Style Social media guidelines While state and federal governments slowly move towards proposing and advancing more comprehensive AI labeling and disclosure requirements, social media platforms are filling the gaps with their own rules. Many of these rules are directed specifically at deceptively realistic AI-generated video, audio and imagery, and include penalties for failing to disclose AI\u2019s role in creating this type of content that can result in such content being removed from the platform. Penalties on many of these platforms also increase for repeated offenses. For example, YouTube states that creators who consistently choose not to make the requisite AI disclosures may be suspended from YouTube\u2019s Partner Program. Advertisers that routinely rely on social media platforms to distribute advertisements must be familiar with the following guidance from major social media platforms regarding labeling and disclosures on AI-generated or altered content, or risk incurring penalties: Meta (e.g.,Facebook, Instagram) regulates the labeling of digitally generated or altered photorealistic video or realistic-sounding audio. Users must label the content (whether in post, story, or Reel form) through their settings before posting. Meta is currently also rolling out a feature in which any ads generated using Meta\u2019s generative AI creative features will automatically be labeled \u201cAI info.\u201d TikTok requires posters to disclose the use of AI relating to realistic images, video and audio. The platform further strongly encourages that disclosures be added to fully AI-generated or significantly AI-edited content, beyond the use of filters or minor retouching. Reddit does not have its own set of comprehensive AI disclosure requirements. However, many individual subreddits have strict rules regarding the use of AI-generated content enforced by active moderators. Moderators can regulate and remove content as needed if it violates the subreddit\u2019s rules. YouTube mandates that creators include a disclosure for any content that is meaningfully altered or synthetically generated and appears realistic. Creators must add this disclosure during the upload process. YouTube reserves the right to apply the disclosure retroactively if the creator fails to include it. The bottom line Just because U.S. federal and state regulations have been slow to catch up to the AI boom does not mean that advertisers always have carte blanche to use AI systems or AI-generated content without notifying consumers. While legislators debate the correct path forward to ensure that consumers have appropriate transparency regarding the use of AI, some relevant laws have already been enacted and others are on the way. At the same time, advertisers must keep in mind the multitude of still-developing labeling and disclosure requirements imposed on AI-generated content by social media platforms. \u201cData-Driven Thinking\u201d is written by members of the media community and contains fresh ideas on the digital revolution in media.
